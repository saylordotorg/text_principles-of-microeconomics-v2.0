    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_p01">Natural resources are the gifts of nature. They include everything from oil to fish in the sea to magnificent scenic vistas. The stock of a natural resource is the quantity of the resource with which the earth is endowed. For example, a certain amount of oil lies in the earth, a certain population of fish live in the sea, and a certain number of acres make up an area such as Yellowstone National Park or Manhattan. These stocks of natural resources, in turn, can be used to produce a flow of goods and services. Each year, we can extract a certain quantity of oil, harvest a certain quantity of fish, and enjoy a certain number of visits to Yellowstone.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_p02">As with capital, we examine the allocation of natural resources among alternative uses across time. By definition, natural resources cannot be produced. Our consumption of the services of natural resources in one period can affect their availability in future periods. We must thus consider the extent to which the expected demands of future generations should be taken into account when we allocate natural resources.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_p03">Natural resources often present problems of property rights in their allocation. A resource for which exclusive property rights have not been defined will be allocated as a common property resource. In such a case, we expect that the marketplace will not generate incentives to use the resource efficiently. In the absence of government intervention, natural resources that are common property may be destroyed. In this section, we shall consider natural resources for which exclusive property rights have been defined. The public sector’s role in the allocation of common property resources is investigated in the chapter on the environment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_p04">We can distinguish two categories of natural resources, those that are renewable and those that are not. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">renewable natural resource</a><span class="glossdef">A resource whose services can be used in one period without necessarily reducing the stock of the resource that will be available in subsequent periods.</span></span> is one whose services can be used in one period without necessarily reducing the stock of the resource that will be available in subsequent periods. The fact that they <em class="emphasis">can</em> be used in such a manner does not mean that they <em class="emphasis">will</em> be; renewable natural resources can be depleted. Wilderness areas, land, and water are renewable natural resources. The consumption of the services of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exhaustible natural resource</a><span class="glossdef">A resource whose services cannot be used in one period without reducing the stock of the resource that will be available in subsequent periods.</span></span>, on the other hand, necessarily reduces the stock of the resource. Oil and coal are exhaustible natural resources.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Exhaustible Natural Resources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_p01">Owners of exhaustible natural resources can be expected to take the interests of future as well as current consumers into account in their extraction decisions. The greater the expected future demand for an exhaustible natural resource, the greater will be the quantity preserved for future use.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Expectations and Resource Extraction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p01">Suppose you are the exclusive owner of a deposit of oil in Wyoming. You know that any oil you pump from this deposit and sell cannot be replaced. You are aware that this is true of all the world’s oil; the consumption of oil inevitably reduces the stock of this resource.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p02">If the quantity of oil in the earth is declining and the demand for this oil is increasing, then it is likely that the price of oil will rise in the future. Suppose you expect the price of oil to increase at an annual rate of 15%.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p03">Given your expectation, should you pump some of your oil out of the ground and sell it? To answer that question, you need to know the interest rate. If the interest rate is 10%, then your best alternative is to leave your oil in the ground. With oil prices expected to rise 15% per year, the dollar value of your oil will increase faster if you leave it in the ground than if you pump it out, sell it, and purchase an interest-earning asset. If the market interest rate were greater than 15%, however, it would make sense to pump the oil and sell it now and use the revenue to purchase an interest-bearing asset. The return from the interest-earning asset, say 16%, would exceed the 15% rate at which you expect the value of your oil to increase. Higher interest rates thus reduce the willingness of resource owners to preserve these resources for future use.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p04">The supply of an exhaustible resource such as oil is thus governed by its current price, its expected future price, and the interest rate. An increase in the expected future price—or a reduction in the interest rate—reduces the supply of oil today, preserving more for future use. If owners of oil expect lower prices in the future, or if the interest rate rises, they will supply more oil today and conserve less for future use. This relationship is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s01_f01">Figure 13.5 "Future Generations and Exhaustible Natural Resources"</a>. The current demand <em class="emphasis">D</em> for these services is given by their marginal revenue product <em class="emphasis">(MRP)</em>. Suppose <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> reflects the current marginal cost of extracting the resource, the prevailing interest rate, and expectations of future demand for the resource. If the interest rate increases, owners will be willing to supply more of the natural resource at each price, thereby shifting the supply curve to the right to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The current price of the resource will fall. If the interest rate falls, the supply curve for the resource will shift to the left to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub> as more owners of the resource decide to leave more of the resource in the earth. As a result, the current price rises.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Resource Prices Over Time</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p01">Since using nonrenewable resources would seem to mean exhausting a fixed supply, then one would expect the prices of exhaustible natural resources to rise over time as the resources become more and more scarce. Over time, however, the prices of most exhaustible natural resources have fluctuated considerably relative to the prices of all other goods and services. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_f01">Figure 13.6 "Natural Resource Prices, 1980–2010"</a> shows the prices of four major exhaustible natural resources 1980 to 2010. Prices have been adjusted for inflation to reflect the prices of these resources relative to other prices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p02">During the final two decades of the twentieth century, exhaustible natural resource prices were generally falling. With the start of the current century, their prices have been rising. In short, why do prices of natural resources fluctuate as they do? Should the process of continuing to “exhaust” them just drive their prices up over time?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p03">In setting their expectations, people in the marketplace must anticipate not only future demand but also future supply as well. Demand in future periods could fall short of expectations if new technologies produce goods and services using less of a natural resource. That has clearly happened. The quantity of energy—which is generally produced using exhaustible fossil fuels—used to produce a unit of output has fallen by more than half in the last three decades. At the same time, rising income levels around the world, particularly in China and India over the last two decades, have led to increased demand for energy. Supply increases when previously unknown deposits of natural resources are discovered and when technologies are developed to extract and refine resources more cheaply. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_f02">Figure 13.7 "An Explanation for Falling Resource Prices"</a> shows that discoveries that reduce the demand below expectations and increase the supply of natural resources can push prices down in a way that people in previous periods might not have anticipated. This scenario explains the fall in some prices of natural resources in the latter part of the twentieth century. To explain the recent rise in exhaustible natural resources prices, we can say that the factors contributing to increased demand for energy and some other exhaustible natural resources were outweighing the factors contributing to increased supply, resulting in higher prices—a scenario opposite to what is shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_f02">Figure 13.7 "An Explanation for Falling Resource Prices"</a>. This upward trend began to reverse itself again in late 2008, as the world economies began to slump and then picked up again.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p04">Will we ever run out of exhaustible natural resources? Past experience suggests that we will not. If no new technologies or discoveries that reduce demand or increase supply occur, then resource prices will rise. As they rise, consumers of these resources will demand lower quantities of these resources. Eventually, the price of a particular resource could rise so high that the quantity demanded would fall to zero. At that point, no more of the resource would be used. There would still be some of the resource in the earth—it simply would not be practical to use more of it. The market simply will not allow us to “run out” of exhaustible natural resources.</p>

Suppose, for example, that a school of 10 million fish increases by 1 million fish each year. The carrying capacity of the school is therefore 1 million fish per year—the harvest of 1 million fish each year will leave the size of the population unchanged. Harvests that exceed a resource’s carrying capacity reduce the stock of the resource; harvests that fall short of it increase that stock.</p>

Suppose, for example, that the price of a one-acre parcel of land is zero. At a price of zero, there is still one acre of land; quantity is unaffected by price. If the price were to rise, there would still be only one acre in the parcel. That means that the price of the parcel exceeds the minimum price—zero—at which the land would be available. The amount by which any price exceeds the minimum price necessary to make a resource available is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">economic rent</a><span class="glossdef">The amount by which any price exceeds the minimum price necessary to make a resource available.</span></span>.</p>

In this sense, much of the salary received by Judge Judy constitutes economic rent. At a low enough salary, she might choose to leave the television industry. How low would depend on what she could earn in a best alternative occupation. If she earns $45 million per year now but could earn $200,000 in a best alternative occupation, then $44.8 million of her salary is economic rent. Most of her current earnings are in the form of economic rent, because her salary substantially exceeds the minimum price necessary to keep her supplying her resources to current purposes.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s02_s02_p10">Back in 1981, Julian Simon, an economist at the Cato Institute, issued a challenge to those who argued that rising prices signaled that the earth was likely to run out of natural resources. He and many other economists argued that rising prices would lead firms to make substitutions and to seek new discoveries and new technologies that would bring prices back down. He told doubters to pick any five exhaustible natural resources. If their average price, adjusted for inflation, rose over the next decade, Simon would pay $1,000. If their price fell, however, he would get the $1,000. Paul Ehrlich, an ecologist, took Mr. Simon up on his offer.  Mr. Ehrlich is the author of the 1968 book, <em class="emphasis">The Population Bomb</em>,  that argued resource scarcity would lead to the starvation of hundreds of millions of people by 1990. Mr. Ehrlich picked chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Since their prices fell over the decade, Mr. Ehrlich paid Mr. Simon $1,000.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s02_s02_p11">In 1990, Mr. Simon offered a “double-or-quits” rematch for any future date. Mr. Simon died in 1998 and Mr. Ehrlich did not agree to take him on again. But, if the original bet were recalculated today, Mr. Ehrlich would have won. The index of the average price of the five resources went from 100 in 1980 down between 40 and 60 for much of the 1990s and is now back to about 100.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s02_s02_p12">Those in the Simon camp, who have been dubbed the Cornucopians, might argue that the recent price rise is due to increased demand from developing countries and that new supplies, technologies, or substitutes will be found that will bring prices back down. Those in the Ehrlich camp, who have been dubbed the Malthusians after Thomas Malthus, the late eighteenth-century economist who argued that population growth would exceed the growth of food supplies, might respond that scarcity is finally taking over.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s02_s02_p18">Since you expect oil prices to rise ($54 − 45)/$45 = 20% and the interest rate is only 10%, you would be better off waiting a year before emptying the well. Another way of seeing this is to compute the present value of the oil a year from now:</p>
                <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">P<sub class="subscript">o</sub></em> = ($54 * 10,000)/(1 + 0.10)<sup class="superscript">1</sup> = $490,909.09</span></span>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s02_s02_p19">Since $490,909 is greater than the $45*10,000 = $450,000 you could earn by emptying the well now, the present value calculation shows the rewards of waiting a year.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch13_s04_s02_s02_p20">If the choice is to empty the well now or in 2 years, however, you would be better off emptying it now, since the present value is only $446,280.99:</p>
