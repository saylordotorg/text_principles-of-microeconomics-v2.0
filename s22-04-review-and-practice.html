        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_p01">In this chapter, we looked at three issues related to the question of fairness: income inequality, poverty, and discrimination.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_p02">The distribution of income in the United States has become more unequal in the last four decades. Among the factors contributing to increased inequality have been changes in family structure, technological change, and tax policy. While rising inequality can be a concern, there is a good deal of movement of families up and down the distribution of income, though recently mobility may have decreased somewhat.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_p03">Poverty can be measured using an absolute or a relative income standard. The official measure of poverty in the United States relies on an absolute standard. This measure tends to overstate the poverty rate because it does not count noncash welfare aid as income. The new supplemental poverty measures have begun to take these programs into account. Poverty is concentrated among female-headed households, minorities, people with relatively little education, and people who are not in the labor force. Children have a particularly high poverty rate.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_p04">Welfare reform in 1996 focused on moving people off welfare and into work. It limits the number of years that individuals can receive welfare payments and allows states to design the specific parameters of their own welfare programs. Following the reform, the number of people on welfare fell dramatically. The long-term impact on poverty is still under investigation.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_p05">Federal legislation bans discrimination. Affirmative action programs, though controversial, are designed to enhance opportunities for minorities and women. Wage gaps between women and white males and between blacks and white males have declined since the 1950s. For black males, however, most of the reduction occurred between 1965 and 1973. Much of the decrease in wage gaps is due to acquisition of human capital by women and blacks, but some of the decrease also reflects a reduction in discrimination.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Concept Problems</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_l01" numeration="arabic">
            <li>Explain how rising demand for college-educated workers and falling demand for high-school-educated workers contributes to increased inequality of the distribution of income.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_p07">Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the following three alternatives for dealing with the rising inequality of wages.</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenberg-ch19_s05_l02" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>Increase the minimum wage each year so that wages for unskilled workers rise as fast as wages for skilled workers.</li>
                    <li>Subsidize the wages of unskilled workers.</li>
                    <li>Do nothing.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>How would you define poverty? How would you determine whether a particular family is poor? Is the test you have proposed an absolute or a relative test?</li>
            <li>Why does the failure to adjust the poverty line for regional differences in living costs lead to an understatement of poverty in some states and an overstatement of poverty in others?</li>
            <li>The text argues that welfare recipients could achieve higher levels of satisfaction if they received cash rather than in-kind aid. Use the same argument to make a case that gifts given at Christmas should be in cash rather than specific items. Why do you suppose they usually are not?</li>
            <li>Suppose a welfare program provides a basic grant of $10,000 per year to poor families but reduces the grant by $1 for every $1 of income earned. How would such a program affect a householdâ€™s incentive to work?</li>
            <li>Welfare reform calls for a two-year limit on welfare payments, after which recipients must go to work. Suppose a recipient with children declines work offers. Should aid be cut? What about the children?</li>
            <li>How would you tackle the welfare problem? State the goals you would seek, and explain how the measures you propose would work to meet those goals.</li>
            <li>Suppose a common but unfounded belief held that people with blue eyes were not as smart as people with brown eyes. What would we expect to happen to the relative wages of the two groups? Suppose you were an entrepreneur who knew that the common belief was wrong. What could you do to enhance your profits? Suppose other entrepreneurs acted in the same way. How would the wages of people with blue eyes be affected?</li>
            <li>The Case in Point on Income Inequality in the United States versus continental Western Europe argues that people get, in effect, what they expect. People in the United States attribute success to hard work and skill, while people in Continental Western Europe attribute success to connections, luck, and corruption. With what set of views do you agree? Explain.</li>
            <li>The Case in Point on welfare reform in Britain versus that in the United States argues that the British system, before it could be adopted in the United States, would require a change in attitudes in the United States. What sort of change would it require? Do you prefer the British approach? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>James Heckman of the University of Chicago advocates a program of early intervention targeted at low income families. What are the advantages of such an approach? The disadvantages?</li>
            <li>Give five reasons that the income distribution in the United States has become more unequal in the last several decades. Do you regard this as a problem for society? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Suppose that all welfare aid were converted to programs of cash assistance. Total spending on welfare would remain unchanged. How would this affect the poverty rate? Why?</li>
