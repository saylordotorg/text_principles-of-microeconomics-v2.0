        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch12_s05_p01">In this chapter we have extended our understanding of the operation of perfectly competitive markets by looking at the market for labor. We found that the common sense embodied in the marginal decision rule is alive and well. A firm should hire additional labor up to the point at which the marginal benefit of doing so equals the marginal cost.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch12_s05_p02">The demand curve for labor is given by the downward-sloping portion of the marginal revenue product (<em class="emphasis">MRP</em>) curve of labor. A profit-maximizing firm will hire labor up to the point at which its marginal revenue product equals its marginal factor cost. The demand for labor shifts whenever there is a change in (1) related factors of production, including investment in human capital; (2) technology; (3) product demand; and (4) the number of firms.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch12_s05_p03">The quantity of labor supplied is closely linked to the demand for leisure. As more hours are worked, income goes up, but the marginal cost of work, measured in terms of forgone leisure, also increases. We saw that the substitution effect of a wage increase always increases the quantity of labor supplied. But the income effect of a wage increase reduces the quantity of labor supplied. It is possible that, above some wage, the income effect more than offsets the substitution effect. At or above that wage, an individual’s supply curve for labor is backward bending. Supply curves for labor in individual markets, however, are likely to be upward sloping.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch12_s05_p04">Because competitive labor markets generate wages equal to marginal revenue product, workers who add little to the value of a firm’s output will receive low wages. The public sector can institute a minimum wage, seek to improve these workers’ human capital, or subsidize their wages.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenberg-ch12_s05_l01" numeration="arabic">
            <li>Explain the difference between the marginal product of a factor and the marginal revenue product of a factor. What factors would change a factor’s marginal product? Its marginal revenue product?</li>
            <li>In perfectly competitive input markets, the factor price and the marginal factor cost are the same. True or false? Explain.</li>
            <li>Many high school vocational education programs are beginning to shift from an emphasis on training students to perform specific tasks to training students to learn new tasks. Students are taught, for example, how to read computer manuals so that they can more easily learn new systems. Why has this change occurred? Do you think the change is desirable?</li>
            <li>How would an increase in the prices of crops of fresh produce that must be brought immediately to market—so-called truck crops—affect the wages of workers who harvest those crops? How do you think it would affect the quantity of labor supplied?</li>
            <li>If individual labor supply curves of all individuals are backward bending, does this mean that a market supply curve for labor in a particular industry will also be backward bending? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>There was an unprecedented wave of immigration to the United States during the latter third of the nineteenth century. Wages, however, rose at a rapid rate throughout the period. Why was the increase in wages surprising in light of rising immigration, and what probably caused it?</li>
            <li>Suppose you were the economic adviser to the president of a small underdeveloped country. What advice would you give him or her with respect to how the country could raise the productivity of its labor force? (<em class="emphasis">Hint:</em> What factors increase labor productivity?)</li>
            <li>The text argues that the effect of a minimum wage on the incomes of workers depends on whether the demand for their services is elastic or inelastic. Explain why.</li>
            <li>How would a successful effort to increase the human capital of unskilled workers affect their wage? Why?</li>
            <li>Do you think that bank tellers and automatic tellers are substitutes or complements? Explain.</li>
            <li>What does the airline pilot’s supply curve in the Case in Point on how she has dealt with wage cutbacks look like? Does the substitution effect or the income effect dominate? How do you know?</li>
            <li>Given the evidence cited in the Case in Point on the increasing wage gap between workers with college degrees and those who have only completed high school, how has the greater use by firms of high-tech capital affected the marginal products of workers with college degrees? How has it affected their marginal revenue product?</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch12_s05_p17">Explain how each of the following events would affect wages in a particular labor market:</p>

                    <li>a reduction in wages in another market whose workers can easily enter the first market.</li>
                    <li>an increase in the price of the good labor in the market produces.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>How can a supply curve for labor be backward bending? Suppose the equilibrium wage occurs in the downward-sloping portion of the curve. How would an increase in the demand for labor in the market affect the wage? How would this affect the quantity of labor supplied?</li>
