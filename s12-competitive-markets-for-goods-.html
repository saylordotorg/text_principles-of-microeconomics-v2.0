        <h2 class="title editable block">Start Up: Life on the Farm</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e244.rittenberg-ch09_s00_p01">They produce a commodity that is essential to our daily lives, one for  which the demand is virtually assured. And yet many—even as farm prices  are reaching record highs—seem to live on the margin of failure.  Thousands are driven out of business each year. We provide billions of  dollars in aid for them, but still we hear of the hardships many of them  face. They are our nation’s farmers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e245.rittenberg-ch09_s00_p02">What is it about farmers, and farming, that arouses our concern? Much of  the answer probably lies in our sense that farming is fundamental to  the American way of life. Our country was built, in large part, by  independent men and women who made their living from the soil. Many of  us perceive their plight as our plight. But part of the answer lies in  the fact that farmers do, in fact, face a difficult economic  environment. Most of them operate in highly competitive markets, markets  that tolerate few mistakes and generally offer small rewards. Finally,  perhaps our concern is stirred by our recognition that the farmers’  plight is our blessing. The low prices that make life difficult for  farmers are the low prices we enjoy as consumers of food.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e246.rittenberg-ch09_s00_p03">What keeps the returns to farming as low as they are? What holds many  farmers in a situation in which they always seem to be just getting by?  In this chapter we shall see that prices just high enough to induce  firms to continue to produce are precisely what we would expect to  prevail in a competitive market. We will examine a model of how  competitive markets work. Not only does this model help to explain the  situation facing farmers, but it will also help us to understand the  determination of price and output in a wide range of markets. A farm is a  firm, and our analysis of such a firm in a competitive market will give  us the tools to analyze the choices of all firms operating in  competitive markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e247.rittenberg-ch09_s00_p04">We will put the concepts of marginal cost, average variable cost, and  average total cost to work to see how firms in a competitive market  respond to market forces. We will see how firms adjust to changes in  demand and supply in the short run and in the long run. In all of this,  we will be examining how firms use the marginal decision rule.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="e249.rittenberg-ch09_s00_p05">The competitive model introduced in this chapter lies at one end of a  spectrum of market models. At the other end is the monopoly model. It  assumes a market in which there is no competition, a market in which  only a single firm operates. Two models that fall between the extremes  of perfect competition and monopoly are monopolistic competition and  oligopoly.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_p01">Virtually all firms in a market economy face competition from other firms. In this chapter, we will be working with a model of a highly idealized form of competition called “perfect” by economists.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Perfect competition</a><span class="glossdef">Model of the market based on the assumption that a large number of firms produce identical goods consumed by a large number of buyers.</span></span> is a model of the market based on the assumption that a large number of firms produce identical goods consumed by a large number of buyers. The model of perfect competition also assumes that it is easy for new firms to enter the market and for existing ones to leave. And finally, it assumes that buyers and sellers have complete information about market conditions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_p03">As we examine these assumptions in greater detail, we will see that they allow us to work with the model more easily. No market fully meets the conditions set out in these assumptions. As is always the case with models, our purpose is to understand the way things work, not to describe them. And the model of perfect competition will prove enormously useful in understanding the world of markets.</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Assumptions of the Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_p01">The assumptions of the model of perfect competition, taken together, imply that individual buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market accept the market price as given. No one buyer or seller has any influence over that price. Individuals or firms who must take the market price as given are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price takers</a><span class="glossdef">Individuals or firms who must take the market price as given.</span></span>. A consumer or firm that takes the market price as given has no ability to influence that price. A price-taking firm or consumer is like an individual who is buying or selling stocks. He or she looks up the market price and buys or sells at that price. The price is determined by demand and supply in the market—not by individual buyers or sellers. In a perfectly competitive market, each firm and each consumer is a price taker. A price-taking consumer assumes that he or she can purchase any quantity at the market price—without affecting that price. Similarly, a price-taking firm assumes it can sell whatever quantity it wishes at the market price without affecting the price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_p02">You are a price taker when you go into a store. You observe the prices listed and make a choice to buy or not. Your choice will not affect that price. Should you sell a textbook back to your campus bookstore at the end of a course, you are a price-taking seller. You are confronted by a market price and you decide whether to sell or not. Your decision will not affect that price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_p03">To see how the assumptions of the model of perfect competition imply price-taking behavior, let us examine each of them in turn.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Identical Goods</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">In a perfectly competitive market for a good or service, one unit of the good or service cannot be differentiated from any other on any basis. A bushel of, say, hard winter wheat is an example. A bushel produced by one farmer is identical to that produced by another. There are no brand preferences or consumer loyalties.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p02">The assumption that goods are identical is necessary if firms are to be price takers. If one farmer’s wheat were perceived as having special properties that distinguished it from other wheat, then that farmer would have some power over its price. By assuming that all goods and services produced by firms in a perfectly competitive market are identical, we establish a necessary condition for price-taking behavior. Economists sometimes say that the goods or services in a perfectly competitive market are <em class="emphasis">homogeneous</em>, meaning that they are all alike. There are no brand differences in a perfectly competitive market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">A Large Number of Buyers and Sellers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p01">How many buyers and sellers are in our market? The answer rests on our presumption of price-taking behavior. There are so many buyers and sellers that none of them has any influence on the market price regardless of how much any of them purchases or sells. A firm in a perfectly competitive market can react to prices, but cannot affect the prices it pays for the factors of production or the prices it receives for its output.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Ease of Entry and Exit</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p01">The assumption that it is easy for other firms to enter a perfectly competitive market implies an even greater degree of competition. Firms in a market must deal not only with the large number of competing firms but also with the possibility that still more firms might enter the market.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p02">Later in this chapter, we will see how ease of entry is related to the sustainability of economic profits. If entry is easy, then the promise of high economic profits will quickly attract new firms. If entry is difficult, it won’t.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p03">The model of perfect competition assumes easy exit as well as easy entry. The assumption of easy exit strengthens the assumption of easy entry. Suppose a firm is considering entering a particular market. Entry may be easy, but suppose that getting out is difficult. For example, suppliers of factors of production to firms in the industry might be happy to accommodate new firms but might require that they sign long-term contracts. Such contracts could make leaving the market difficult and costly. If that were the case, a firm might be hesitant to enter in the first place. Easy exit helps make entry easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Complete Information</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s04_p01">We assume that all sellers have complete information about prices, technology, and all other knowledge relevant to the operation of the market. No one seller has any information about production methods that is not available to all other sellers. If one seller had an advantage over other sellers, perhaps special information about a lower-cost production method, then that seller could exert some control over market price—the seller would no longer be a price taker.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s04_p02">We assume also that buyers know the prices offered by every seller. If buyers did not know about prices offered by different firms in the market, then a firm might be able to sell a good or service for a price other than the market price and thus could avoid being a price taker.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s04_p03">The availability of information that is assumed in the model of perfect competition implies that information can be obtained at low cost. If consumers and firms can obtain information at low cost, they are likely to do so. Information about the marketplace may come over the internet, over the airways in a television commercial, or over a cup of coffee with a friend. Whatever its source, we assume that its low cost ensures that consumers and firms have enough of it so that everyone buys or sells goods and services at market prices determined by the intersection of demand and supply curves.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s01_s04_p04">The assumptions of the perfectly competitive model ensure that each buyer or seller is a price taker. The market, not individual consumers or firms, determines price in the model of perfect competition. No individual has enough power in a perfectly competitive market to have any impact on that price.</p>

    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Perfect Competition and the Real World</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p01">The assumptions of identical products, a large number of buyers, easy entry and exit, and perfect information are strong assumptions. The notion that firms must sit back and let the market determine price seems to fly in the face of what we know about most real firms, which is that firms customarily do set prices. Yet this is the basis for the model of demand and supply, the power of which you have already seen.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p02">When we use the model of demand and supply, we assume that market forces determine prices. In this model, buyers and sellers respond to the market price. They are price takers. The assumptions of the model of perfect competition underlie the assumption of price-taking behavior. Thus we are using the model of perfect competition whenever we apply the model of demand and supply.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p03">We can understand most markets by applying the model of demand and supply. Even though those markets do not fulfill all the assumptions of the model of perfect competition, the model allows us to understand some key features of these markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p04">Changes within your lifetime have made many markets more competitive. Falling costs of transportation, together with dramatic advances in telecommunications, have opened the possibility of entering markets to firms all over the world. A company in South Korea can compete in the market for steel in the United States. A furniture maker in New Mexico can compete in the market for furniture in Japan. A firm can enter the world market simply by creating a web page to advertise its products and to take orders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p05">In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will learn more about the response of firms to market prices. We will see how firms respond, in the short run and in the long run, to changes in demand and to changes in production costs. In short, we will be examining the forces that constitute the supply side of the model of demand and supply.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p06">We will also see how competitive markets work to serve consumer interests and how competition acts to push economic profits down, sometimes eliminating them entirely. When we have finished we will have a better understanding of the market conditions facing farmers and of the conditions that prevail in any competitive industry.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p14">Muhammed Ibrahim Islamadin was driving a cab in Kabul, Afghanistan, when the Taliban took over the country. He foresaw the repression that would follow and sensed an opportunity.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p15">He sold his taxicab and set up a shop for sewing and selling burkhas, the garments required of all women under the Taliban’s rule. Mr. Islamadin had an easy task selling, as women caught outdoors with exposed skin were routinely beaten by the Taliban’s religious police. He told <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em>, “This was very bad for them, but it was good for me.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p16">Of course, Mr. Islamadin was not the only producer to get into the industry. Other Afghani merchants, as well as merchants from Pakistan and China, also jumped at the opportunity.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p17">The entry of new firms exemplifies an important characteristic of perfect competition. Whenever there is an opportunity to earn economic profits—even an unexpected opportunity—new firms will enter, provided that entry is easy.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p18">The model of perfect competition also assumes that exit will be easy if and when a firm experiences economic losses. When the Taliban rulers were ousted by the United States and its allies in 2001, Mr. Islamadin expected that the demand for burkhas would begin to fall. It did. The sales fell 50% almost immediately. Prices fell as well, generally by about 20%.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s02_s02_p19">It was simple for Mr. Islamadin to leave the industry. He gave his remaining stock of burkhas to a brother who was producing them in the countryside where women continued to wear them. As for Mr. Islamadin, he has made plans to go into the glassware business. He expects the demand for glass teacups to be strong whatever happens in Afghanistan’s critical future.</p>

We shall see that the firm can maximize economic profit by applying the marginal decision rule and increasing output up to the point at which the marginal benefit of an additional unit of output is just equal to the marginal cost. This fact has an important implication: over a wide range of output, the firm’s marginal cost curve is its supply curve.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p01">Each firm in a perfectly competitive market is a price taker; the equilibrium price and industry output are determined by demand and supply. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_f01">Figure 9.1 "The Market for Radishes"</a> shows how demand and supply in the market for radishes, which we shall assume are produced under conditions of perfect competition, determine total output and price. The equilibrium price is $0.40 per pound; the equilibrium quantity is 10 million pounds per month.</p>

            <p class="para">Price and output in a competitive market are determined by demand and supply. In the market for radishes, the equilibrium price is $0.40 per pound; 10 million pounds per month are produced and purchased at this price.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p02">Because it is a price taker, each firm in the radish industry assumes it can sell all the radishes it wants at a price of $0.40 per pound. No matter how many or how few radishes it produces, the firm expects to sell them all at the market price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p03">The assumption that the firm expects to sell all the radishes it wants at the market price is crucial. If a firm did not expect to sell all of its radishes at the market price—if it had to lower the price to sell some quantities—the firm would not be a price taker. And price-taking behavior is central to the model of perfect competition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p04">Radish growers—and perfectly competitive firms in general—have no reason to charge a price lower than the market price. Because buyers have complete information and because we assume each firm’s product is identical to that of its rivals, firms are unable to charge a price higher than the market price. For perfectly competitive firms, the price is very much like the weather: they may complain about it, but in perfect competition there is nothing any of them can do about it.</p>

It equals the change in the vertical axis (total revenue) divided by the change in the horizontal axis (quantity) between any two points. The slope measures the rate at which total revenue increases as output increases. We can think of it as the increase in total revenue associated with a 1-unit increase in output. The increase in total revenue from a 1-unit increase in quantity is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal revenue</a><span class="glossdef">The increase in total revenue from a one-unit increase in quantity.</span></span>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s02_p02">How much additional revenue does a radish producer gain from selling one more pound of radishes? The answer, of course, is the market price for 1 pound. Marginal revenue equals the market price. Because the market price is not affected by the output choice of a single firm, the marginal revenue the firm gains by producing one more unit is always the market price. The marginal revenue curve shows the relationship between marginal revenue and the quantity a firm produces. For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal revenue curve is a horizontal line at the market price. If the market price of a pound of radishes is $0.40, then the marginal revenue is $0.40. Marginal revenue curves for prices of $0.20, $0.40, and $0.60 are given in Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Total Revenue, Marginal Revenue, and Average Revenue"</a>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p02">Consider the case of a single radish producer, Tony Gortari. We assume that the radish market is perfectly competitive; Mr. Gortari runs a perfectly competitive firm. Suppose the market price of radishes is $0.40 per pound. How many pounds of radishes can Mr. Gortari sell at this price? The answer comes from our assumption that he is a price taker: He can sell <em class="emphasis">any</em> quantity he wishes at this price. How many pounds of radishes will he sell if he charges a price that exceeds the market price? None. His radishes are identical to those of every other firm in the market, and everyone in the market has complete information. That means the demand curve facing Mr. Gortari is a horizontal line at the market price as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 9.3 "Price, Marginal Revenue, and Demand"</a>. Notice that the curve is labeled <em class="emphasis">d</em> to distinguish it from the market demand curve, <em class="emphasis">D</em>, in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_f01">Figure 9.1 "The Market for Radishes"</a>. The horizontal line in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 9.3 "Price, Marginal Revenue, and Demand"</a> is also Mr. Gortari’s marginal revenue curve, <em class="emphasis">MR</em>, and his average revenue curve, <em class="emphasis">AR</em>.

We assume he can sell all the radishes he wants at the market price; there would be no reason to charge a lower price. Mr. Gortari faces a demand curve that is a horizontal line at the market price. In our subsequent analysis, we shall refer to the horizontal line at the market price simply as marginal revenue. We should remember, however, that this same line gives us the market price, average revenue, and the demand curve facing the firm.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p01">A firm’s economic profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. Recall that total cost is the opportunity cost of producing a certain good or service. When we speak of economic profit we are speaking of a firm’s total revenue less the total opportunity cost of its operations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p02">As we learned, a firm’s total cost curve in the short run intersects the vertical axis at some positive value equal to the firm’s total fixed costs. Total cost then rises at a decreasing rate over the range of increasing marginal returns to the firm’s variable factors. It rises at an increasing rate over the range of diminishing marginal returns. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit"</a> shows the total cost curve for Mr. Gortari, as well as the total revenue curve for a price of $0.40 per pound. Suppose that his total fixed cost is $400 per month. For any given level of output, Mr. Gortari’s economic profit is the vertical distance between the total revenue curve and the total cost curve at that level.</p>

            <p class="para">Economic profit is the vertical distance between the total revenue and total cost curves (revenue minus costs). Here, the maximum profit attainable by Tony Gortari for his radish production is $938 per month at an output of 6,700 pounds.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p03">Let us examine the total revenue and total cost curves in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit"</a> more carefully. At zero units of output, Mr. Gortari’s total cost is $400 (his total fixed cost); total revenue is zero. Total cost continues to exceed total revenue up to an output of 1,500 pounds per month, at which point the two curves intersect. At this point, economic profit equals zero. As Mr. Gortari expands output above 1,500 pounds per month, total revenue becomes greater than total cost. We see that at a quantity of 1,500 pounds per month, the total revenue curve is steeper than the total cost curve. Because revenues are rising faster than costs, profits rise with increased output. As long as the total revenue curve is steeper than the total cost curve, profit increases as the firm increases its output.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p04">The total revenue curve’s slope does not change as the firm increases its output. But the total cost curve becomes steeper and steeper as diminishing marginal returns set in. Eventually, the total cost and total revenue curves will have the same slope. That happens in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit"</a> at an output of 6,700 pounds of radishes per month. Notice that a line drawn tangent to the total cost curve at that quantity has the same slope as the total revenue curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p05">As output increases beyond 6,700 pounds, the total cost curve continues to become steeper. It becomes steeper than the total revenue curve, and profits fall as costs rise faster than revenues. At an output slightly above 8,000 pounds per month, the total revenue and cost curves intersect again, and economic profit equals zero. Mr. Gortari achieves the greatest profit possible by producing 6,700 pounds of radishes per month, the quantity at which the total cost and total revenue curves have the same slope. More generally, we can conclude that a perfectly competitive firm maximizes economic profit at the output level at which the total revenue curve and the total cost curve have the same slope.</p>

Economic profit, the difference between total revenue and total cost, is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This is consistent with the marginal decision rule, which holds that a profit-maximizing firm should increase output until the marginal benefit of an additional unit equals the marginal cost. The marginal benefit of selling an additional unit is measured as marginal revenue.

Whenever price is greater than average variable cost, the firm maximizes economic profit (or minimizes economic loss) by producing the output level at which marginal revenue and marginal cost curves intersect.</p>

Suppose, for example, he decided to operate where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, producing 1,700 pounds of radishes per month. Average variable cost equals $0.14 per pound, so he would lose $0.04 on each pound he produces ($68) plus his fixed cost of $400 per month. He would lose $468 per month.

            <h3 class="title">Case in Point: Not Out of Business ’Til They Fall from the Sky</h3>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p14">The 66 satellites were poised to start falling from the sky. The hope was that the pieces would burn to bits on their way down through the atmosphere, but there was the chance that a building or a person would take a direct hit.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p15">The satellites were the primary communication devices of Iridium’s satellite phone system. Begun in 1998 as the first truly global satellite system for mobile phones—providing communications across deserts, in the middle of oceans, and at the poles—Iridium expected five million subscribers to pay $7 a minute to talk on $3,000 handsets. In the climate of the late 1990s, users opted for cheaper, though less secure and less comprehensive, cell phones. By the end of the decade, Iridium had declared bankruptcy, shut down operations, and was just waiting for the satellites to start plunging from their orbits around 2007.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p16">The only offer for Iridium’s $5 billion system came from an ex-CEO of a nuclear reactor business, Dan Colussy, and it was for a measly $25 million. “It’s like picking up a $150,000 Porsche 911 for $750,” wrote <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> reporter, Kevin Maney.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p17">The purchase turned into a bonanza. In the wake of September 11, 2001, and then the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, demand for secure communications in remote locations skyrocketed. New customers included the U.S. and British militaries, as well as reporters in Iraq, who, when traveling with the military have been barred from using less secure systems that are easier to track. The nonprofit organization Operation Call Home has bought time to allow members of the 81<sup class="superscript">st</sup> Armor Brigade of the Washington National Guard to communicate with their families at home. Airlines and shipping lines have also signed up.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p18">As the new Iridium became unburdened from the debt of the old one and technology improved, the lower fixed and variable costs have contributed to Iridium’s revival, but clearly a critical element in the turnaround has been increased demand. The launching of an additional seven spare satellites and other tinkering have extended the life of the system to at least 2014. The firm was temporarily shut down but, with its new owners and new demand for its services, has come roaring back.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p19">Why did Colussy buy Iridium? A top executive in the new firm said that Colussy just found the elimination of the satellites a terrible waste. Perhaps he had some niche uses in mind, as even before September 11, 2001, he had begun to enroll some new customers, such as the Colombian national police, who no doubt found the system useful in the fighting drug lords. But it was in the aftermath of 9/11 that its subscriber list really began to grow and its re-opening was deemed a stroke of genius. Today Iridium’s customers include ships at sea (which account for about half of its business), airlines, military uses, and a variety of commercial and humanitarian applications.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Economic profits and losses play a crucial role in the model of perfect competition. The existence of economic profits in a particular industry attracts new firms to the industry in the long run. As new firms enter, the supply curve shifts to the right, price falls, and profits fall. Firms continue to enter the industry until economic profits fall to zero. If firms in an industry are experiencing economic losses, some will leave. The supply curve shifts to the left, increasing price and reducing losses. Firms continue to leave until the remaining firms are no longer suffering losses—until economic profits are zero.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Before examining the mechanism through which entry and exit eliminate economic profits and losses, we shall examine an important key to understanding it: the difference between the accounting and economic concepts of profit and loss.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p01">Economic profit equals total revenue minus total cost, where cost is measured in the economic sense as opportunity cost. An economic loss (negative economic profit) is incurred if total cost exceeds total revenue.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p02">Accountants include only explicit costs in their computation of total cost. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Explicit costs</a><span class="glossdef">Charges that must be paid for factors of production such as labor and capital.</span></span> include charges that must be paid for factors of production such as labor and capital, together with an estimate of depreciation. Profit computed using only explicit costs is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accounting profit</a><span class="glossdef">Profit computed using only explicit costs.</span></span>. It is the measure of profit firms typically report; firms pay taxes on their accounting profits, and a corporation reporting its profit for a particular period reports its accounting profits. To compute his accounting profits, Mr. Gortari, the radish farmer, would subtract explicit costs, such as charges for labor, equipment, and other supplies, from the revenue he receives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p03">Economists recognize costs in addition to the explicit costs listed by accountants. If Mr. Gortari were not growing radishes, he could be doing something else with the land and with his own efforts. Suppose the most valuable alternative use of his land would be to produce carrots, from which Mr. Gortari could earn $250 per month in accounting profits. The income he forgoes by not producing carrots is an opportunity cost of producing radishes. This cost is not explicit; the return Mr. Gortari could get from producing carrots will not appear on a conventional accounting statement of his accounting profit. A cost that is included in the economic concept of opportunity cost, but that is not an explicit cost, is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">implicit cost</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that is included in the economic concept of opportunity cost but that is not an explicit cost.</span></span>.</p>

Suppose there are two industries in the economy, and that firms in Industry A are earning economic profits. By definition, firms in Industry A are earning a return greater than the return available in Industry B. That means that firms in Industry B are earning less than they could in Industry A.

As former Industry B firms enter Industry A, the supply curve in Industry A will shift to the right, lowering profits in A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p01">In our examination of entry and exit in response to economic profit or loss in a perfectly competitive industry, we assumed that the <em class="emphasis">ATC</em> curve of a single firm does not shift as new firms enter or existing firms leave the industry. That is the case when expansion or contraction does not affect prices for the factors of production used by firms in the industry. When expansion of the industry does not affect the prices of factors of production, it is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">constant-cost industry</a><span class="glossdef">Industry in which expansion does not affect the prices of factors of production.</span></span>. In some cases, however, the entry of new firms may affect input prices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p02">As new firms enter, they add to the demand for the factors of production used by the industry. If the industry is a significant user of those factors, the increase in demand could push up the market price of factors of production for all firms in the industry. If that occurs, then entry into an industry will boost average costs at the same time as it puts downward pressure on price. Long-run equilibrium will still occur at a zero level of economic profit and with firms operating on the lowest point on the <em class="emphasis">ATC</em> curve, but that cost curve will be somewhat higher than before entry occurred. Suppose, for example, that an increase in demand for new houses drives prices higher and induces entry. That will increase the demand for workers in the construction industry and is likely to result in higher wages in the industry, driving up costs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p03">An industry in which the entry of new firms bids up the prices of factors of production and thus increases production costs is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">increasing-cost industry</a><span class="glossdef">Industry in which the entry of new firms bids up the prices of factors of production and thus increases production costs.</span></span>. As such an industry expands in the long run, its price will rise.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p04">Some industries may experience reductions in input prices as they expand with the entry of new firms. That may occur because firms supplying the industry experience economies of scale as they increase production, thus driving input prices down. Expansion may also induce technological changes that lower input costs. That is clearly the case of the computer industry, which has enjoyed falling input costs as it has expanded. An industry in which production costs fall as firms enter in the long run is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decreasing-cost industry</a><span class="glossdef">Industry in which production costs fall in the long run as firms enter.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p05">Just as industries may expand with the entry of new firms, they may contract with the exit of existing firms. In a constant-cost industry, exit will not affect the input prices of remaining firms. In an increasing-cost industry, exit will reduce the input prices of remaining firms. And, in a decreasing-cost industry, input prices may rise with the exit of existing firms.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p06">The behavior of production costs as firms in an industry expand or reduce their output has important implications for the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long-run industry supply curve</a><span class="glossdef">A curve that relates the price of a good or service to the quantity produced after all long-run adjustments to a price change have been completed.</span></span>, a curve that relates the price of a good or service to the quantity produced after all long-run adjustments to a price change have been completed. Every point on a long-run supply curve therefore shows a price and quantity supplied at which firms in the industry are earning zero economic profit. Unlike the short-run market supply curve, the long-run industry supply curve does not hold factor costs and the number of firms unchanged.</p>

Having determined how the profit-maximizing firms of the model would respond, we can then predict firms’ responses to similar changes in the real world.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p16">Generic prescription drugs are essentially identical substitutes for more expensive brand-name prescription drugs. Since the passage of the Drug Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act) made it easier for manufacturers to enter the market for generic drugs, the generic drug industry has taken off. Generic drugs represented 19% of the prescription drug industry in 1984 and today represent more than two-thirds of the industry. U.S. generic sales were $29 billion in 1995 and soared to $176 billion in 2009. In 2009, the average price of a branded prescription was $155 compared to $40 for a generic prescription.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p17">A study by David Reiffen and Michael R. Ward published in 2005 showed that entry into the generic drug industry has been the key to this price differential. As shown in the table, when there are one to three manufacturers selling generic copies of a given branded drug, the ratio of the generic price to the branded price is about 83%. The ratio falls to 76% when there are four to six competitors, 72.1% when there are seven to nine competitors, 69% when there are ten competitors, and 68% when there are eleven or more competitors.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p100">They also found that the extent to which prices approach competitive levels depends on the potential revenue in the market for a drug. So long as markets are sufficiently large, entry of generic competitors leads to prices that are close to marginal cost (i.e., at near-competitive pricing levels).</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p18">The generic drug industry is largely characterized by the attributes of a perfectly competitive market. Competitors have good information about the product and sell identical products. The 1984 legislation eased entry into this market. And as the model of perfect competition predicts, entry has driven prices down, benefiting consumers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars each year.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p01">The assumptions of the model of perfect competition ensure that every decision maker is a price taker—the interaction of demand and supply in the market determines price. Although most firms in real markets have some control over their prices, the model of perfect competition suggests how changes in demand or in production cost will affect price and output in a wide range of real-world cases.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p02">A firm in perfect competition maximizes profit in the short run by producing an output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, provided marginal revenue is at least as great as the minimum value of average variable cost. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue equals price and average revenue. This implies that the firm’s marginal cost curve is its short-run supply curve for values greater than average variable cost. If price drops below average variable cost, the firm shuts down.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p03">If firms in an industry are earning economic profit, entry by new firms will drive price down until economic profit achieves its long-run equilibrium value of zero. If firms are suffering economic losses, exit by existing firms will continue until price rises to eliminate the losses and economic profits are zero. A long-run equilibrium may be changed by a change in demand or in production cost, which would affect supply. The adjustment to the change in the short run is likely to result in economic profits or losses; these will be eliminated in the long run by entry or by exit.</p>

            <li>Explain how each of the assumptions of perfect competition contributes to the fact that all decision makers in perfect competition are price takers.</li>

            <li>Explain the difference between marginal revenue, average revenue, and price in perfect competition.</li>
            <li>Suppose the only way a firm can increase its sales is to lower its price. Is this a perfectly competitive firm? Why or why not?</li>

            <li>You have decided to major in biology rather than computer science. A news report suggests that the salaries of computer science majors are increasing. How does this affect the opportunity cost of your choice?</li>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p18">Explain how each of the following events would affect the marginal cost curves of firms and thus the supply curve in a perfectly competitive market in the short run.</p>

            <li>In a perfectly competitive market, who benefits from an event that lowers production costs for firms?</li>
            <li>Dry-cleaning establishments generate a considerable amount of air pollution in producing cleaning services. Suppose these firms are allowed to pollute without restriction and that reducing their pollution would add significantly to their production costs. Who benefits from the fact that they pollute the air? Now suppose the government requires them to reduce their pollution. Who will pay for the cleanup? (Assume dry cleaning is a perfectly competitive industry, and answer these questions from a long-run perspective.)</li>
            <li>The late columnist William F. Buckley, commenting on a strike by the Teamsters Union against UPS in 1997, offered this bit of economic analysis to explain how UPS had succeeded in reducing its average total cost: “UPS has done this by ‘economies of scale.’ Up to a point (where the marginal cost equals the price of the marginal unit), the larger the business, the less the per-unit cost.” Use the concept of economies of scale, together with the information presented in this chapter, to explain the error in Mr. Buckley’s statement. <span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenberg-fn09_001">William F. Buckley, “Carey Took on ‘Greed’ as His Battle Cry,” <em class="emphasis">The Gazette</em>, 22 August 1997, News 7 (a Universal Press Syndicate column).</span>
</li>
            <li>Suppose that a perfectly competitive industry is in long-run equilibrium and experiences an increase in production cost. Who will bear the burden of the increase? Is this fair?</li>
            <li>Economists argue that the ultimate beneficiaries of the efforts of perfectly competitive firms are consumers. In what sense is this the case? Do the owners of perfectly competitive firms derive any long-run benefit from their efforts?</li>
            <li>Explain carefully why a fixed license fee does not shift a firm’s marginal cost curve in the short run. What about the long run?</li>
