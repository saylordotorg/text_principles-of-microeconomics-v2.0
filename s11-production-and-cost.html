        <h2 class="title editable block">Start Up: Street Cleaning Around the World</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e838.rittenberg-ch08_s00_p01">It is dawn in Shanghai, China. Already thousands of Chinese are out cleaning the city’s streets. They are using brooms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e839.rittenberg-ch08_s00_p02">On the other side of the world, night falls in Washington, D.C., where the streets are also being cleaned—by a handful of giant street-sweeping machines driven by a handful of workers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e840.rittenberg-ch08_s00_p03">The difference in method is not the result of a greater knowledge of modern technology in the United States—the Chinese know perfectly well how to build street-sweeping machines. It is a production decision based on costs in the two countries. In China, where wages are relatively low, an army of workers armed with brooms is the least expensive way to produce clean streets. In Washington, where labor costs are high, it makes sense to use more machinery and less labor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e841.rittenberg-ch08_s00_p04">All types of production efforts require choices in the use of factors of production. In this chapter we examine such choices. Should a good or service be produced using relatively more labor and less capital? Or should relatively more capital and less labor be used? What about the use of natural resources?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e842.rittenberg-ch08_s00_p05">In this chapter we see why firms make the production choices they do and how their costs affect their choices. We will apply the marginal decision rule to the production process and see how this rule ensures that production is carried out at the lowest cost possible. We examine the nature of production and costs in order to gain a better understanding of supply. We thus shift our focus to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">firms</a><span class="glossdef">Organizations that produce goods and services.</span></span>, organizations that produce goods and services. In producing goods and services, firms combine the factors of production—labor, capital, and natural resources—to produce various products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e483.rittenberg-ch08_s00_p06">Economists assume that firms engage in production in order to earn a profit and that they seek to make this profit as large as possible. That is, economists assume that firms apply the marginal decision rule as they seek to maximize their profits. Whether we consider the operator of a shoe-shine stand at an airport or the firm that produces airplanes, we will find there are basic relationships between the use of factors of production and output levels, and between output levels and costs, that apply to all production. The production choices of firms and their associated costs are at the foundation of supply.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p01">Our analysis of production and cost begins with a period economists call the short run. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">short run</a><span class="glossdef">A planning period over which the managers of a firm must consider one or more of their factors of production as fixed in quantity.</span></span> in this microeconomic context is a planning period over which the managers of a firm must consider one or more of their factors of production as fixed in quantity. For example, a restaurant may regard its building as a fixed factor over a period of at least the next year. It would take at least that much time to find a new building or to expand or reduce the size of its present facility. Decisions concerning the operation of the restaurant during the next year must assume the building will remain unchanged. Other factors of production could be changed during the year, but the size of the building must be regarded as a constant.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p02">When the quantity of a factor of production cannot be changed during a particular period, it is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed factor of production</a><span class="glossdef">A factor of production whose quantity cannot be changed during a particular period.</span></span>. For the restaurant, its building is a fixed factor of production for at least a year. A factor of production whose quantity can be changed during a particular period is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variable factor of production</a><span class="glossdef">A factor of production whose quantity can be changed during a particular period.</span></span>; factors such as labor and food are examples.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p03">While the managers of the restaurant are making choices concerning its operation over the next year, they are also planning for longer periods. Over those periods, managers may contemplate alternatives such as modifying the building, building a new facility, or selling the building and leaving the restaurant business. The planning period over which a firm can consider <em class="emphasis">all</em> factors of production as variable is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long run</a><span class="glossdef">The planning period over which a firm can consider all factors of production as variable.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p04">At any one time, a firm will be making both short-run and long-run choices. The managers may be planning what to do for the next few weeks and for the next few years. Their decisions over the next few weeks are likely to be short-run choices. Decisions that will affect operations over the next few years may be long-run choices, in which managers can consider changing every aspect of their operations. Our analysis in this section focuses on the short run. We examine long-run choices later in this chapter.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_p01">A firm uses factors of production to produce a product.

When you read in the newspaper that productivity is rising or falling, or that productivity in the United States is nine times greater than productivity in China, the report is probably referring to some measure of the average product of labor.</p>

Panel (b) shows the marginal product and average product curves. Notice that marginal product is the slope of the total product curve, and that marginal product rises as the slope of the total product curve increases, falls as the slope of the total product curve declines, reaches zero when the total product curve achieves its maximum value, and becomes negative as the total product curve slopes downward. As in other parts of this text, marginal values are plotted at the midpoint of each interval. The marginal product of the fifth unit of labor, for example, is plotted between 4 and 5 units of labor. Also notice that the marginal product curve intersects the average product curve at the maximum point on the average product curve. When marginal product is above average product, average product is rising. When marginal product is below average product, average product is falling.</p>

Your grade point average (GPA) represents the average grade you have earned in all your course work so far. When you take an additional course, your grade in that course represents the marginal grade. What happens to your GPA when you get a grade that is higher than your previous average? It rises. What happens to your GPA when you get a grade that is lower than your previous average? It falls. If your GPA is a 3.0 and you earn one more B, your marginal grade equals your GPA and your GPA remains unchanged.</p>

However, unlike your course grades, which may go up and down willy-nilly, marginal product always rises and then falls, for reasons we will explore shortly. As soon as marginal product falls below average product, the average product curve slopes downward. While marginal product is above average product, whether marginal product is increasing or decreasing, the average product curve slopes upward.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p01">Adding the first worker increases Acme’s output from 0 to 1 jacket per day. The second tailor adds 2 jackets to total output; the third adds 4. The marginal product goes up because when there are more workers, each one can specialize to a degree. One worker might cut the cloth, another might sew the seams, and another might sew the buttonholes. Their increasing marginal products are reflected by the increasing slope of the total product curve over the first 3 units of labor and by the upward slope of the marginal product curve over the same range. The range over which marginal products are increasing is called the range of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">increasing marginal returns</a><span class="glossdef">The range over which each additional unit of a variable factor adds more to total output than the previous unit.</span></span>. Increasing marginal returns exist in the context of a total product curve for labor, so we are holding the quantities of other factors constant. Increasing marginal returns may occur for any variable factor.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p02">The fourth worker adds less to total output than the third; the marginal product of the fourth worker is 2 jackets. The data in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> show that marginal product continues to decline after the fourth worker as more and more workers are hired. The additional workers allow even greater opportunities for specialization, but because they are operating with a fixed amount of capital, each new worker adds less to total output. The fifth tailor adds only a single jacket to total output. When each additional unit of a variable factor adds less to total output, the firm is experiencing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diminishing marginal returns</a><span class="glossdef">The range over which each additional unit of a variable factor adds less to total output than the previous unit.</span></span>. Over the range of diminishing marginal returns, the marginal product of the variable factor is positive but falling. Once again, we assume that the quantities of all other factors of production are fixed. Diminishing marginal returns may occur for any variable factor. Panel (b) shows that Acme experiences diminishing marginal returns between the third and seventh workers, or between 7 and 11 jackets per day.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p03">After the seventh unit of labor, Acme’s fixed plant becomes so crowded that adding another worker actually reduces output.

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p05">It is easy to confuse the concept of diminishing marginal returns with the idea of negative marginal returns. To say a firm is experiencing diminishing marginal returns is not to say its output is falling. Diminishing marginal returns mean that the marginal product of a variable factor is declining. Output is still increasing as the variable factor is increased, but it is increasing by smaller and smaller amounts. As we saw in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 8.3 "Increasing Marginal Returns, Diminishing Marginal Returns, and Negative Marginal Returns"</a>, the range of diminishing marginal returns was between the third and seventh workers; over this range of workers, output rose from 7 to 11 jackets. Negative marginal returns started after the seventh worker.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p06">To see the logic of the law of diminishing marginal returns, imagine a case in which it does not hold. Say that you have a small plot of land for a vegetable garden, 10 feet by 10 feet in size. The plot itself is a fixed factor in the production of vegetables. Suppose you are able to hold constant all other factors—water, sunshine, temperature, fertilizer, and seed—and vary the amount of labor devoted to the garden. How much food could the garden produce? Suppose the marginal product of labor kept increasing or was constant. Then you could grow an <em class="emphasis">unlimited</em> quantity of food on your small plot—enough to feed the entire world! You could add an unlimited number of workers to your plot and still increase output at a constant or increasing rate. If you did not get enough output with, say, 500 workers, you could use 5 million; the five-millionth worker would add at least as much to total output as the first. If diminishing marginal returns to labor did not occur, the total product curve would slope upward at a constant or increasing rate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p07">The shape of the total product curve and the shape of the resulting marginal product curve drawn in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> are typical of <em class="emphasis">any</em> firm for the short run. Given its fixed factors of production, increasing the use of a variable factor will generate increasing marginal returns at first; the total product curve for the variable factor becomes steeper and the marginal product rises. The opportunity to gain from increased specialization in the use of the variable factor accounts for this range of increasing marginal returns. Eventually, though, diminishing returns will set in. The total product curve will become flatter, and the marginal product curve will fall.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_p01">A firm’s costs of production depend on the quantities and prices of its factors of production. Because we expect a firm’s output to vary with the firm’s use of labor in a specific way, we can also expect the firm’s costs to vary with its output in a specific way. We shall put our information about Acme’s product curves to work to discover how a firm’s costs vary with its level of output.</p>

For most firms, variable costs includes costs for raw materials, salaries of production workers, and utilities.

A term commonly used for fixed costs is <em class="emphasis">overhead</em>. Notice that fixed costs exist only in the short run.

The total cost curve, for example, starts at $200 when Acme produces 0 jackets—that is its total fixed cost. The curve rises, but at a decreasing rate, up to the seventh jacket. Beyond the seventh jacket, the curve becomes steeper and steeper. The slope of the total variable cost curve behaves in precisely the same way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p09">Recall that Acme experienced increasing marginal returns to labor for the first three units of labor—or the first seven jackets. Up to the third worker, each additional worker added more and more to Acme’s output. Over the range of increasing marginal returns, each additional jacket requires less and less additional labor. The first jacket required one tailor; the second required the addition of only a part-time tailor; the third required only that Acme boost that part-time tailor’s hours to a full day. Up to the seventh jacket, each additional jacket requires less and less additional labor, and thus costs rise at a decreasing rate; the total cost and total variable cost curves become flatter over the range of increasing marginal returns.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p10">Acme experiences diminishing marginal returns beyond the third unit of labor—or the seventh jacket. Notice that the total cost and total variable cost curves become steeper and steeper beyond this level of output. In the range of diminishing marginal returns, each additional unit of a factor adds less and less to total output. That means each additional unit of output requires larger and larger increases in the variable factor, and larger and larger increases in costs.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p19">Sports physiologists often measure the “total product” of training as the increase in an athlete’s aerobic capacity—the capacity to absorb oxygen into the bloodstream. An athlete can be thought of as producing aerobic capacity using a fixed factor (his or her natural capacity) and a variable input (exercise). The chart shows how this aerobic capacity varies with the number of workouts per week. The curve has a shape very much like a total product curve—which, after all, is precisely what it is.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p20">The data suggest that an athlete experiences increasing marginal returns from exercise for the first three days of training each week; indeed, over half the total gain in aerobic capacity possible is achieved. A person can become even more fit by exercising more, but the gains become smaller with each added day of training. The law of diminishing marginal returns applies to training.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p21">The increase in fitness that results from the sixth and seventh workouts each week is small. Studies also show that the costs of daily training, in terms of increased likelihood of injury, are high. Many trainers and coaches now recommend that athletes—at all levels of competition—take a day or two off each week.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_p01">In a long-run planning perspective, a firm can consider changing the quantities of <em class="emphasis">all</em> its factors of production. That gives the firm opportunities it does not have in the short run. First, the firm can select the mix of factors it wishes to use. Should it choose a production process with lots of labor and not much capital, like the street sweepers in China? Or should it select a process that uses a great deal of capital and relatively little labor, like street sweepers in the United States? The second thing the firm can select is the scale (or overall size) of its operations. In the short run, a firm can increase output only by increasing its use of a variable factor. But in the long run, all factors are variable, so the firm can expand the use of all of its factors of production. The question facing the firm in the long run is: How much of an expansion or contraction in the scale of its operations should it undertake? Alternatively, it could choose to go out of business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_p02">In its long-run planning, the firm not only regards all factors as variable, but it regards all costs as variable as well. There are no fixed costs in the long run. Because all costs are variable, the structure of costs in the long run differs somewhat from what we saw in the short run.</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing the Factor Mix</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p01">How shall a firm decide what mix of capital, labor, and other factors to use? We can apply the marginal decision rule to answer this question.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p02">Suppose a firm uses capital and labor to produce a particular good. It must determine how to produce the good and the quantity it should produce. We address the question of how much the firm should produce in subsequent chapters, but certainly the firm will want to produce whatever quantity it chooses at as low a cost as possible. Another way of putting that goal is to say that the firm seeks the maximum output possible at every level of total cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p03">At any level of total cost, the firm can vary its factor mix. It could, for example, substitute labor for capital in a way that leaves its total cost unchanged. In terms of the marginal decision rule, we can think of the firm as considering whether to spend an additional $1 on one factor, hence $1 less on another. The marginal decision rule says that a firm will shift spending among factors as long as the marginal benefit of such a shift exceeds the marginal cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p04">What is the marginal benefit, say, of an additional $1 spent on capital? An additional unit of capital produces the marginal product of capital. To determine the marginal benefit of $1 spent on capital, we divide capital’s marginal product by its price: <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript">K</sub>/<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">K</sub>. The price of capital is the “rent” paid for the use of a unit of capital for a given period. If the firm already owns the capital, then this rent is an opportunity cost; it represents the return the firm could get by renting the capital to another user or by selling it and earning interest on the money thus gained.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p05">If capital and labor are the only factors, then spending an additional $1 on capital while holding total cost constant means taking $1 out of labor. The cost of that action will be the output lost from cutting back $1 worth of labor. That cost equals the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the price of labor, <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript">L</sub>/<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">L</sub>, where the price of labor is the wage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p06">Suppose that a firm’s marginal product of labor is 15 and the price of labor is $5 per unit; the firm gains 3 units of output by spending an additional $1 on labor. Suppose further that the marginal product of capital is 50 and the price of capital is $50 per unit, so the firm would lose 1 unit of output by spending $1 less on capital.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p12">As the price of labor rises, the firm will shift to a factor mix that uses relatively more capital and relatively less labor. As a firm increases its ratio of capital to labor, we say it is becoming more <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital intensive</a><span class="glossdef">Situation in which a firm has a high ratio of capital to labor.</span></span>. A lower price for labor will lead the firm to use relatively more labor and less capital, reducing its ratio of capital to labor. As a firm reduces its ratio of capital to labor, we say it is becoming more <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">labor intensive</a><span class="glossdef">Situation in which a firm has a high ratio of labor to capital.</span></span>. The notions of labor-intensive and capital-intensive production are purely relative; they imply only that a firm has a higher or lower ratio of capital to labor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p13">Sometimes economists speak of labor-intensive versus capital-intensive countries in the same manner. One implication of the marginal decision rule for factor use is that firms in countries where labor is relatively expensive, such as the United States, will use capital-intensive production methods. Less developed countries, where labor is relatively cheap, will use labor-intensive methods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s01_p14">Now that we understand how to apply the marginal decision rule to the problem of choosing the mix of factors, we can answer the question that began this chapter: Why does the United States employ a capital-intensive production process to clean streets while China chooses a labor-intensive process? Given that the same technology—know-how—is available, both countries could, after all, use the same production process. Suppose for a moment that the relative prices of labor and capital are the same in China and the United States. In that case, China and the United States can be expected to use the same method to clean streets. But the price of labor relative to the price of capital is, in fact, far lower in China than in the United States. A lower relative price for labor increases the ratio of the marginal product of labor to its price, making it efficient to substitute labor for capital. China thus finds it cheaper to clean streets with lots of people using brooms, while the United States finds it efficient to clean streets with large machines and relatively less labor.</p>

They complete part of the production process in the United States, using capital-intensive methods. They then ship the unfinished goods to <em class="emphasis">maquiladoras</em>. For example, many U.S. clothing manufacturers produce cloth at U.S. plants on large high-speed looms. They then ship the cloth to Mexico, where it is fashioned into clothing by workers using sewing machines. Another example is plastic injection molding, which requires highly skilled labor and is made in the U.S. The parts are molded in Texas border towns and are then shipped to <em class="emphasis">maquiladoras</em> and used in cars and computers. The resulting items are shipped back to the United States, labeled “Assembled in Mexico from U.S. materials.” Overall maquiladoras import 97% of the components they use, of which 80 to 85% come from the U.S.</p>

It works because different factor prices imply different mixes of labor and capital. Companies are able to carry out the capital-intensive side of the production process in the United States and the labor-intensive side in Mexico. <span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenberg-fn08_001">Lucinda Vargas, “Maquiladoras: Impact on Texas Border Cities,” in <em class="emphasis">The Border Economy</em>, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (June 2001): 25–29; William C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_p01">As in the short run, costs in the long run depend on the firm’s level of output, the costs of factors, and the quantities of factors needed for each level of output. The chief difference between long- and short-run costs is there are no fixed factors in the long run. There are thus no fixed costs. All costs are variable, so we do not distinguish between total variable cost and total cost in the long run: total cost <em class="emphasis">is</em> total variable cost.</p>

The <em class="emphasis">LRAC</em> curve assumes that the firm has chosen the optimal factor mix, as described in the previous section, for producing any level of output. The costs it shows are therefore the lowest costs possible for each level of output. It is important to note, however, that this does not mean that the minimum points of each short-run ATC curves lie on the <em class="emphasis">LRAC</em> curve. This critical point is explained in the next paragraph and expanded upon even further in the next section.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_p03"><a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_f01">Figure 8.9 "Relationship Between Short-Run and Long-Run Average Total Costs"</a> shows how a firm’s <em class="emphasis">LRAC</em> curve is derived. Suppose Lifetime Disc Co. produces compact discs (CDs) using capital and labor. We have already seen how a firm’s average total cost curve can be drawn in the short run for a given quantity of a particular factor of production, such as capital. In the short run, Lifetime Disc might be limited to operating with a given amount of capital; it would face one of the short-run average total cost curves shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_f01">Figure 8.9 "Relationship Between Short-Run and Long-Run Average Total Costs"</a>. If it has 30 units of capital, for example, its average total cost curve is <em class="emphasis">ATC</em><sub class="subscript">30</sub>. In the long run the firm can examine the average total cost curves associated with varying levels of capital. Four possible short-run average total cost curves for Lifetime Disc are shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_f01">Figure 8.9 "Relationship Between Short-Run and Long-Run Average Total Costs"</a> for quantities of capital of 20, 30, 40, and 50 units.

Again, notice that the U-shaped <em class="emphasis">LRAC</em> curve is an envelope curve that surrounds the various short-run ATC curves. With the exception of <em class="emphasis">ATC</em><sub class="subscript">40</sub>, in this example, the lowest cost per unit for a particular level of output in the long run is not the minimum point of the relevant short-run curve.</p>

The lowest cost per unit is achieved with production of 30,000 CDs per week using 40 units of capital (point C).

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p02">Why would a firm experience economies of scale? One source of economies of scale is gains from specialization. As the scale of a firm’s operation expands, it is able to use its factors in more specialized ways, increasing their productivity. Another source of economies of scale lies in the economies that can be gained from mass production methods. As the scale of a firm’s operation expands, the company can begin to utilize large-scale machines and production systems that can substantially reduce cost per unit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p03">Why would a firm experience diseconomies of scale? At first glance, it might seem that the answer lies in the law of diminishing marginal returns, but this is not the case. The law of diminishing marginal returns, after all, tells us how output changes as a single factor is increased, with all other factors of production held constant. In contrast, diseconomies of scale describe a situation of rising average cost even when the firm is free to vary any or all of its factors as it wishes. Diseconomies of scale are generally thought to be caused by management problems. As the scale of a firm’s operations expands, it becomes harder and harder for management to coordinate and guide the activities of individual units of the firm. Eventually, the diseconomies of management overwhelm any gains the firm might be achieving by operating with a larger scale of plant, and long-run average costs begin rising. Firms experience constant returns to scale at output levels where there are neither economies nor diseconomies of scale. For the range of output over which the firm experiences constant returns to scale, the long-run average cost curve is horizontal.</p>

At very low levels of output, the firm is likely to experience economies of scale as it expands the scale of its operations. There may follow a range of output over which the firm experiences constant returns to scale—empirical studies suggest that the range over which firms experience constant returns to scale is often very large. And certainly there must be some range of output over which diseconomies of scale occur; this phenomenon is one factor that limits the size of firms.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p01">Economies and diseconomies of scale have a powerful effect on the sizes of firms that will operate in any market. Suppose firms in a particular industry experience diseconomies of scale at relatively low levels of output. That industry will be characterized by a large number of fairly small firms. The restaurant market appears to be such an industry. Barbers and beauticians are another example.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p02">If firms in an industry experience economies of scale over a very wide range of output, firms that expand to take advantage of lower cost will force out smaller firms that have higher costs. Such industries are likely to have a few large firms instead of many small ones. In the refrigerator industry, for example, the size of firm necessary to achieve the lowest possible cost per unit is large enough to limit the market to only a few firms. In most cities, economies of scale leave room for only a single newspaper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p03">One factor that can limit the achievement of economies of scale is the demand facing an individual firm. The scale of output required to achieve the lowest unit costs possible may require sales that exceed the demand facing a firm. A grocery store, for example, could minimize unit costs with a large store and a large volume of sales. But the demand for groceries in a small, isolated community may not be able to sustain such a volume of sales. The firm is thus limited to a small scale of operation even though this might involve higher unit costs.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p09">How big should the call switching equipment a major telecommunications company uses be? Having bigger machines results in economies of scale but also raises the risk of larger outages that will affect more customers.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p10">Verizon Laboratories economist Donald E. Smith examined both the economies of scale available from larger equipment and the greater danger of more widespread outages. He concluded that companies should not use the largest machines available because of the outage danger and that they should not use the smallest size because that would mean forgoing the potential gains from economies of scale of larger sizes.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p11">Switching machines, the large computers that handle calls for telecommunications companies, come in four basic “port matrix sizes.” These are measured in terms of Digital Cross-Connects (DCS’s). The four DCS sizes available are 6,000; 12,000; 24,000; and 36,000 ports. Different machine sizes are made with the same components and thus have essentially the same probability of breaking down. Because larger machines serve more customers, however, a breakdown in a large machine has greater consequences for the company.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p12">The costs of an outage have three elements. The first is lost revenue from calls that would otherwise have been completed. Second, the FCC requires companies to provide a credit of one month of free service after any outage that lasts longer than one minute. Finally, an outage damages a company’s reputation and inevitably results in dissatisfied customers—some of whom may switch to other companies.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p13">But, there are advantages to larger machines. A company has a “portfolio” of switching machines. Having larger machines lowers costs in several ways. First, the initial acquisition of the machine generates lower cost per call completed the greater the size of the machine. When the company must make upgrades to the software, having fewer—and larger—machines means fewer upgrades and thus lower costs.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p14">In deciding on matrix size companies should thus compare the cost advantages of a larger matrix with the disadvantages of the higher outage costs associated with those larger matrixes.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p15">Mr. Smith concluded that the economies of scale outweigh the outage risks as a company expands beyond 6,000 ports but that 36,000 ports is “too big” in the sense that the outage costs outweigh the advantage of the economies of scale. The evidence thus suggests that a matrix size in the range of 12,000 to 24,000 ports is optimal.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s04_p01">In this chapter we have concentrated on the production and cost relationships facing firms in the short run and in the long run.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s04_p02">In the short run, a firm has at least one factor of production that it cannot vary. This fixed factor limits the firm’s range of factor choices. As a firm uses more and more of a variable factor (with fixed quantities of other factors of production), it is likely to experience at first increasing, then diminishing, then negative marginal returns. Thus, the short-run total cost curve has a positive value at a zero level of output (the firm’s total fixed cost), then slopes upward at a decreasing rate (the range of increasing marginal returns), and then slopes upward at an increasing rate (the range of diminishing marginal returns).</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s04_p03">In addition to short-run total product and total cost curves, we derived a firm’s marginal product, average product, average total cost, average variable cost, average fixed cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s04_p04">If the firm is to maximize profit in the long run, it must select the cost-minimizing combination of factors for its chosen level of output. Thus, the firm must try to use factors of production in accordance with the marginal decision rule. That is, it will use factors so that the ratio of marginal product to factor price is equal for all factors of production.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s04_p05">A firm’s long-run average cost (<em class="emphasis">LRAC</em>) curve includes a range of economies of scale, over which the curve slopes downward, and a range of diseconomies of scale, over which the curve slopes upward. There may be an intervening range of output over which the firm experiences constant returns to scale; its <em class="emphasis">LRAC</em> curve will be horizontal over this range. The size of operations necessary to reach the lowest point on the <em class="emphasis">LRAC</em> curve has a great deal to do with determining the relative sizes of firms in an industry.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s04_p06">This chapter has focused on the nature of production processes and the costs associated with them. These ideas will prove useful in understanding the behavior of firms and the decisions they make concerning supply of goods and services.</p>
