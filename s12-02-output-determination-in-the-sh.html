We shall see that the firm can maximize economic profit by applying the marginal decision rule and increasing output up to the point at which the marginal benefit of an additional unit of output is just equal to the marginal cost. This fact has an important implication: over a wide range of output, the firm’s marginal cost curve is its supply curve.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p01">Each firm in a perfectly competitive market is a price taker; the equilibrium price and industry output are determined by demand and supply. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_f01">Figure 9.1 "The Market for Radishes"</a> shows how demand and supply in the market for radishes, which we shall assume are produced under conditions of perfect competition, determine total output and price.

            <p class="para">Price and output in a competitive market are determined by demand and supply. In the market for radishes, the equilibrium price is $0.40 per pound; 10 million pounds per month are produced and purchased at this price.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p02">Because it is a price taker, each firm in the radish industry assumes it can sell all the radishes it wants at a price of $0.40 per pound. No matter how many or how few radishes it produces, the firm expects to sell them all at the market price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p03">The assumption that the firm expects to sell all the radishes it wants at the market price is crucial. If a firm did not expect to sell all of its radishes at the market price—if it had to lower the price to sell some quantities—the firm would not be a price taker. And price-taking behavior is central to the model of perfect competition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_p04">Radish growers—and perfectly competitive firms in general—have no reason to charge a price lower than the market price. Because buyers have complete information and because we assume each firm’s product is identical to that of its rivals, firms are unable to charge a price higher than the market price. For perfectly competitive firms, the price is very much like the weather: they may complain about it, but in perfect competition there is nothing any of them can do about it.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p03">The relationship between market price and the firm’s total revenue curve is a crucial one. Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Total Revenue, Marginal Revenue, and Average Revenue"</a> shows total revenue curves for a radish grower at three possible market prices: $0.20, $0.40, and $0.60 per pound. Each total revenue curve is a linear, upward-sloping curve. At any price, the greater the quantity a perfectly competitive firm sells, the greater its total revenue. Notice that the greater the price, the steeper the total revenue curve is.</p>

A total revenue curve is a straight line coming out of the origin. The slope of a total revenue curve is <em class="emphasis">MR;</em> it equals the market price (<em class="emphasis">P</em>) and <em class="emphasis">AR</em> in perfect competition.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s02_p01">The slope of a total revenue curve is particularly important. It equals the change in the vertical axis (total revenue) divided by the change in the horizontal axis (quantity) between any two points. The slope measures the rate at which total revenue increases as output increases. We can think of it as the increase in total revenue associated with a 1-unit increase in output. The increase in total revenue from a 1-unit increase in quantity is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal revenue</a><span class="glossdef">The increase in total revenue from a one-unit increase in quantity.</span></span>. Thus marginal revenue (<em class="emphasis">MR</em>) equals the slope of the total revenue curve.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s02_p02">How much additional revenue does a radish producer gain from selling one more pound of radishes? The answer, of course, is the market price for 1 pound. Marginal revenue equals the market price. Because the market price is not affected by the output choice of a single firm, the marginal revenue the firm gains by producing one more unit is always the market price. The marginal revenue curve shows the relationship between marginal revenue and the quantity a firm produces. For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal revenue curve is a horizontal line at the market price. If the market price of a pound of radishes is $0.40, then the marginal revenue is $0.40. Marginal revenue curves for prices of $0.20, $0.40, and $0.60 are given in Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Total Revenue, Marginal Revenue, and Average Revenue"</a>. In perfect competition, a firm’s marginal revenue curve is a horizontal line at the market price.</p>

The average and marginal revenue curves are given by the same horizontal line. This is consistent with what we have learned about the relationship between marginal and average values. When the marginal value exceeds the average value, the average value will be rising. When the marginal value is less than the average value, the average value will be falling. What happens when the average and marginal values do not change, as in the horizontal curves of Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Total Revenue, Marginal Revenue, and Average Revenue"</a>? The marginal value must equal the average value; the two curves coincide.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p02">Consider the case of a single radish producer, Tony Gortari. We assume that the radish market is perfectly competitive; Mr. Gortari runs a perfectly competitive firm. Suppose the market price of radishes is $0.40 per pound. How many pounds of radishes can Mr. Gortari sell at this price? The answer comes from our assumption that he is a price taker: He can sell <em class="emphasis">any</em> quantity he wishes at this price. How many pounds of radishes will he sell if he charges a price that exceeds the market price? None. His radishes are identical to those of every other firm in the market, and everyone in the market has complete information. That means the demand curve facing Mr. Gortari is a horizontal line at the market price as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 9.3 "Price, Marginal Revenue, and Demand"</a>. Notice that the curve is labeled <em class="emphasis">d</em> to distinguish it from the market demand curve, <em class="emphasis">D</em>, in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_f01">Figure 9.1 "The Market for Radishes"</a>. The horizontal line in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 9.3 "Price, Marginal Revenue, and Demand"</a> is also Mr. Gortari’s marginal revenue curve, <em class="emphasis">MR</em>, and his average revenue curve, <em class="emphasis">AR</em>. It is also the market price, <em class="emphasis">P</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p03">Of course, Mr. Gortari could charge a price below the market price, but why would he? We assume he can sell all the radishes he wants at the market price; there would be no reason to charge a lower price. Mr. Gortari faces a demand curve that is a horizontal line at the market price. In our subsequent analysis, we shall refer to the horizontal line at the market price simply as marginal revenue. We should remember, however, that this same line gives us the market price, average revenue, and the demand curve facing the firm.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Profit in the Short Run</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p01">A firm’s economic profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. Recall that total cost is the opportunity cost of producing a certain good or service. When we speak of economic profit we are speaking of a firm’s total revenue less the total opportunity cost of its operations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p02">As we learned, a firm’s total cost curve in the short run intersects the vertical axis at some positive value equal to the firm’s total fixed costs. Total cost then rises at a decreasing rate over the range of increasing marginal returns to the firm’s variable factors. It rises at an increasing rate over the range of diminishing marginal returns. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit"</a> shows the total cost curve for Mr. Gortari, as well as the total revenue curve for a price of $0.40 per pound. Suppose that his total fixed cost is $400 per month. For any given level of output, Mr. Gortari’s economic profit is the vertical distance between the total revenue curve and the total cost curve at that level.</p>
        <div class="figure large editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 9.4</span> Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit</p>

            <p class="para">Economic profit is the vertical distance between the total revenue and total cost curves (revenue minus costs). Here, the maximum profit attainable by Tony Gortari for his radish production is $938 per month at an output of 6,700 pounds.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p03">Let us examine the total revenue and total cost curves in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit"</a> more carefully. At zero units of output, Mr. Gortari’s total cost is $400 (his total fixed cost); total revenue is zero. Total cost continues to exceed total revenue up to an output of 1,500 pounds per month, at which point the two curves intersect. At this point, economic profit equals zero. As Mr. Gortari expands output above 1,500 pounds per month, total revenue becomes greater than total cost. We see that at a quantity of 1,500 pounds per month, the total revenue curve is steeper than the total cost curve. Because revenues are rising faster than costs, profits rise with increased output. As long as the total revenue curve is steeper than the total cost curve, profit increases as the firm increases its output.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p04">The total revenue curve’s slope does not change as the firm increases its output. But the total cost curve becomes steeper and steeper as diminishing marginal returns set in. Eventually, the total cost and total revenue curves will have the same slope. That happens in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_f01">Figure 9.4 "Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Economic Profit"</a> at an output of 6,700 pounds of radishes per month. Notice that a line drawn tangent to the total cost curve at that quantity has the same slope as the total revenue curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s02_p05">As output increases beyond 6,700 pounds, the total cost curve continues to become steeper. It becomes steeper than the total revenue curve, and profits fall as costs rise faster than revenues. At an output slightly above 8,000 pounds per month, the total revenue and cost curves intersect again, and economic profit equals zero. Mr. Gortari achieves the greatest profit possible by producing 6,700 pounds of radishes per month, the quantity at which the total cost and total revenue curves have the same slope. More generally, we can conclude that a perfectly competitive firm maximizes economic profit at the output level at which the total revenue curve and the total cost curve have the same slope.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s03_p01">The slope of the total revenue curve is marginal revenue; the slope of the total cost curve is marginal cost. Economic profit, the difference between total revenue and total cost, is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This is consistent with the marginal decision rule, which holds that a profit-maximizing firm should increase output until the marginal benefit of an additional unit equals the marginal cost. The marginal benefit of selling an additional unit is measured as marginal revenue. Finding the output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost is thus an application of our marginal decision rule.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p14">The 66 satellites were poised to start falling from the sky. The hope was that the pieces would burn to bits on their way down through the atmosphere, but there was the chance that a building or a person would take a direct hit.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p15">The satellites were the primary communication devices of Iridium’s satellite phone system. Begun in 1998 as the first truly global satellite system for mobile phones—providing communications across deserts, in the middle of oceans, and at the poles—Iridium expected five million subscribers to pay $7 a minute to talk on $3,000 handsets. In the climate of the late 1990s, users opted for cheaper, though less secure and less comprehensive, cell phones. By the end of the decade, Iridium had declared bankruptcy, shut down operations, and was just waiting for the satellites to start plunging from their orbits around 2007.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p16">The only offer for Iridium’s $5 billion system came from an ex-CEO of a nuclear reactor business, Dan Colussy, and it was for a measly $25 million. “It’s like picking up a $150,000 Porsche 911 for $750,” wrote <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> reporter, Kevin Maney.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p17">The purchase turned into a bonanza. In the wake of September 11, 2001, and then the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, demand for secure communications in remote locations skyrocketed. New customers included the U.S. and British militaries, as well as reporters in Iraq, who, when traveling with the military have been barred from using less secure systems that are easier to track. The nonprofit organization Operation Call Home has bought time to allow members of the 81<sup class="superscript">st</sup> Armor Brigade of the Washington National Guard to communicate with their families at home. Airlines and shipping lines have also signed up.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p18">As the new Iridium became unburdened from the debt of the old one and technology improved, the lower fixed and variable costs have contributed to Iridium’s revival, but clearly a critical element in the turnaround has been increased demand. The launching of an additional seven spare satellites and other tinkering have extended the life of the system to at least 2014. The firm was temporarily shut down but, with its new owners and new demand for its services, has come roaring back.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s03_s05_p19">Why did Colussy buy Iridium? A top executive in the new firm said that Colussy just found the elimination of the satellites a terrible waste. Perhaps he had some niche uses in mind, as even before September 11, 2001, he had begun to enroll some new customers, such as the Colombian national police, who no doubt found the system useful in the fighting drug lords. But it was in the aftermath of 9/11 that its subscriber list really began to grow and its re-opening was deemed a stroke of genius. Today Iridium’s customers include ships at sea (which account for about half of its business), airlines, military uses, and a variety of commercial and humanitarian applications.</p>
