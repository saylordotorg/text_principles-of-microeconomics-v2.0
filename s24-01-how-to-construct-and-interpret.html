    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_p01">Much of the analysis in economics deals with relationships between variables. A variable is simply a quantity whose value can change. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">graph</a><span class="glossdef">A pictorial representation of the relationship between two or more variables.</span></span> is a pictorial representation of the relationship between two or more variables. The key to understanding graphs is knowing the rules that apply to their construction and interpretation. This section defines those rules and explains how to draw a graph.</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Drawing a Graph</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_p01">To see how a graph is constructed from numerical data, we will consider a hypothetical example. Suppose a college campus has a ski club that organizes day-long bus trips to a ski area about 100 miles from the campus. The club leases the bus and charges $10 per passenger for a round trip to the ski area. In addition to the revenue the club collects from passengers, it also receives a grant of $200 from the school’s student government for each day the bus trip is available. The club thus would receive $200 even if no passengers wanted to ride on a particular day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_p02">The table in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a> shows the relationship between two variables: the number of students who ride the bus on a particular day and the revenue the club receives from a trip. In the table, each combination is assigned a letter (A, B, etc.); we will use these letters when we transfer the information from the table to a graph.</p>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 21.1</span> Ski Club Revenues</p>
            <img src="section_24/ffdadb4bcc4dc56effe25e0a203482a1.jpg">
            <p class="para">The ski club receives $10 from each passenger riding its bus for a trip to and from the ski area plus a payment of $200 from the student government for each day the bus is available for these trips. The club’s revenues from any single day thus equal $200 plus $10 times the number of passengers. The table relates various combinations of the number of passengers and club revenues.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_p03">We can illustrate the relationship shown in the table with a graph. The procedure for showing the relationship between two variables, like the ones in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a>, on a graph is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a>. Let us look at the steps involved.</p>

        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1. Draw and Label the Axes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p01">The two variables shown in the table are the number of passengers taking the bus on a particular day and the club’s revenue from that trip. We begin our graph in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a> by drawing two axes to form a right angle. Each axis will represent a variable. The axes should be carefully labeled to reflect what is being measured on each axis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p02">It is customary to place the independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. Recall that, when two variables are related, the dependent variable is the one that changes in response to changes in the independent variable. Passengers generate revenue, so we can consider the number of passengers as the independent variable and the club’s revenue as the dependent variable. The number of passengers thus goes on the horizontal axis; the club’s revenue from a trip goes on the vertical axis. In some cases, the variables in a graph cannot be considered independent or dependent. In those cases, the variables may be placed on either axis; we will encounter such a case in the chapter that introduces the production possibilities model. In other cases, economists simply ignore the rule; we will encounter that case in the chapter that introduces the model of demand and supply. The rule that the independent variable goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable goes on the vertical usually holds, but not always.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p03">The point at which the axes intersect is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">origin</a><span class="glossdef">The point at which the axes of a graph intersect.</span></span> of the graph. Notice that in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a> the origin has a value of zero for each variable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p04">In drawing a graph showing numeric values, we also need to put numbers on the axes. For the axes in Panel (a), we have chosen numbers that correspond to the values in the table. The number of passengers ranges up to 40 for a trip; club revenues from a trip range from $200 (the payment the club receives from student government) to $600. We have extended the vertical axis to $800 to allow some changes we will consider below. We have chosen intervals of 10 passengers on the horizontal axis and $100 on the vertical axis. The choice of particular intervals is mainly a matter of convenience in drawing and reading the graph; we have chosen the ones here because they correspond to the intervals given in the table.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p05">We have drawn vertical lines from each of the values on the horizontal axis and horizontal lines from each of the values on the vertical axis. These lines, called gridlines, will help us in Step 2.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2. Plot the Points</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p06">Each of the rows in the table in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a> gives a combination of the number of passengers on the bus and club revenue from a particular trip. We can plot these values in our graph.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p07">We begin with the first row, A, corresponding to zero passengers and club revenue of $200, the payment from student government. We read up from zero passengers on the horizontal axis to $200 on the vertical axis and mark point A. This point shows that zero passengers result in club revenues of $200.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p08">The second combination, B, tells us that if 10 passengers ride the bus, the club receives $300 in revenue from the trip—$100 from the $10-per-passenger charge plus the $200 from student government. We start at 10 passengers on the horizontal axis and follow the gridline up. When we travel up in a graph, we are traveling with respect to values on the vertical axis. We travel up by $300 and mark point B.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p09">Points in a graph have a special significance. They relate the values of the variables on the two axes to each other. Reading to the left from point B, we see that it shows $300 in club revenue. Reading down from point B, we see that it shows 10 passengers. Those values are, of course, the values given for combination B in the table.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p10">We repeat this process to obtain points C, D, and E. Check to be sure that you see that each point corresponds to the values of the two variables given in the corresponding row of the table.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p11">The graph in Panel (b) is called a scatter diagram. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scatter diagram</a><span class="glossdef">A graph that shows individual points relating values of the variable on one axis to values of the variable on the other.</span></span> shows individual points relating values of the variable on one axis to values of the variable on the other.</p>

        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3. Draw the Curve</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03_p01">The final step is to draw the curve that shows the relationship between the number of passengers who ride the bus and the club’s revenues from the trip. The term “curve” is used for any line in a graph that shows a relationship between two variables.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03_p02">We draw a line that passes through points A through E. Our curve shows club revenues; we shall call it <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. Notice that <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> is an upward-sloping straight line. Notice also that <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> intersects the vertical axis at $200 (point A). The point at which a curve intersects an axis is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intercept</a><span class="glossdef">The point at which a curve intersects an axis.</span></span> of the curve. We often refer to the vertical or horizontal intercept of a curve; such intercepts can play a special role in economic analysis. The vertical intercept in this case shows the revenue the club would receive on a day it offered the trip and no one rode the bus.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03_p03">To check your understanding of these steps, we recommend that you try plotting the points and drawing <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> for yourself in Panel (a). Better yet, draw the axes for yourself on a sheet of graph paper and plot the curve.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Slope of a Curve</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p01">In this section, we will see how to compute the slope of a curve. The slopes of curves tell an important story: they show the rate at which one variable changes with respect to another.</p>

In this example, the equation is written in words. Sometimes we use symbols in place of words. The basic idea though, is always the same: the term represented on the left side of the equals sign equals the term on the right side. In <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_eq01" xrefstyle="select: label">Equation 21.1</a> there are three variables: the slope, the vertical change, and the horizontal change. If we know the values of two of the three, we can compute the third.

Point B corresponds to 10 passengers on the bus; point D corresponds to 30. The change in the horizontal axis when we go from B to D thus equals 20 passengers. Point B corresponds to club revenues of $300; point D corresponds to club revenues of $500. The change in the vertical axis equals $200.

        <p class="para block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p11">Notice that we can compute the slope of <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> between any two points on the curve and get the same value; the slope is constant. Consider, for example, points A and E. The vertical change between these points is $400 (we go from revenues of $200 at A to revenues of $600 at E). The horizontal change is 40 passengers (from zero passengers at A to 40 at E). The slope between A and E thus equals <span class="inlineequation"><span class="mathphrase">$400/(40 passengers) = $10/passenger</span></span>. We get the same slope regardless of which pair of points we pick on <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to compute the slope. The slope of <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> can be considered a constant, which suggests that it is a straight line. When the curve showing the relationship between two variables has a constant slope, we say there is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">linear relationship</a><span class="glossdef">Relationship that exists between two variables when the curve between them has a constant slope.</span></span> between the variables. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">linear curve</a><span class="glossdef">A curve with constant slope.</span></span> is a curve with constant slope.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p12">The fact that the slope of our curve equals $10/passenger tells us something else about the curve—$10/passenger is a positive, not a negative, value. A curve whose slope is positive is upward sloping. As we travel up and to the right along <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, we travel in the direction of increasing values for both variables. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">positive relationship</a><span class="glossdef">Relationship that exists between two variables when both variables move in the same direction.</span></span> between two variables is one in which both variables move in the same direction. Positive relationships are sometimes called direct relationships. There is a positive relationship between club revenues and passengers on the bus.

A negative relationship is sometimes called an inverse relationship. The slope of a curve describing a negative relationship is always negative. A curve with a negative slope is always downward sloping.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p02">As an example of a graph of a negative relationship, let us look at the impact of the cancellation of games by the National Basketball Association during the 1998–1999 labor dispute on the earnings of one player: Shaquille O’Neal. During the 1998–1999 season, O’Neal was the center for the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p03">O’Neal’s salary with the Lakers in 1998–1999 would have been about $17,220,000 had the 82 scheduled games of the regular season been played. But a contract dispute between owners and players resulted in the cancellation of 32 games. Mr. O’Neal’s salary worked out to roughly $210,000 per game, so the labor dispute cost him well over $6 million. Presumably, he was able to eke out a living on his lower income, but the cancellation of games cost him a great deal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p04">We show the relationship between the number of games canceled and O’Neal’s 1998–1999 basketball earnings graphically in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_f01">Figure 21.5 "Canceling Games and Reducing Shaquille O’Neal’s Earnings"</a>. Canceling games reduced his earnings, so the number of games canceled is the independent variable and goes on the horizontal axis. O’Neal’s earnings are the dependent variable and go on the vertical axis. The graph assumes that his earnings would have been $17,220,000 had no games been canceled (point A, the vertical intercept). Assuming that his earnings fell by $210,000 per game canceled, his earnings for the season were reduced to $10,500,000 by the cancellation of 32 games (point B). We can draw a line between these two points to show the relationship between games canceled and O’Neal’s 1998–1999 earnings from basketball. In this graph, we have inserted a break in the vertical axis near the origin. This allows us to expand the scale of the axis over the range from $10,000,000 to $18,000,000. It also prevents a large blank space between the origin and an income of $10,500,000—there are no values below this amount.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p06">Notice that this time the slope is negative, hence the downward-sloping curve. As we travel down and to the right along the curve, the number of games canceled rises and O’Neal’s salary falls. In this case, the slope tells us the rate at which O’Neal lost income as games were canceled.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p07">The slope of O’Neal’s salary curve is also constant. That means there was a linear relationship between games canceled and his 1998–1999 basketball earnings.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s04_p01">When we draw a graph showing the relationship between two variables, we make an important assumption. We assume that all other variables that might affect the relationship between the variables in our graph are unchanged. When one of those other variables changes, the relationship changes, and the curve showing that relationship shifts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s04_p02">Consider, for example, the ski club that sponsors bus trips to the ski area. The graph we drew in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a> shows the relationship between club revenues from a particular trip and the number of passengers on that trip, assuming that all other variables that might affect club revenues are unchanged. Let us change one. Suppose the school’s student government increases the payment it makes to the club to $400 for each day the trip is available. The payment was $200 when we drew the original graph. Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s04_f01">Figure 21.6 "Shifting a Curve: An Increase in Revenues"</a> shows how the increase in the payment affects the table we had in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a>; Panel (b) shows how the curve shifts. Each of the new observations in the table has been labeled with a prime: A′, B′, etc. The curve <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> shifts upward by $200 as a result of the increased payment.

If, for example, the student government is paying the club $400 each day it makes the ski bus available and 20 passengers ride the bus, the club is operating at point C′ on <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. If the number of passengers increases to 30, the club will be at point D′ on the curve. This is a movement along a curve; the curve itself does not shift.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s04_p04">Now suppose that, instead of increasing its payment, the student government eliminates its payments to the ski club for bus trips. The club’s only revenue from a trip now comes from its $10/passenger charge. We have again changed one of the variables we were holding unchanged, so we get another shift in our revenue curve. The table in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s04_f02">Figure 21.7 "Shifting a Curve: A Reduction in Revenues"</a> shows how the reduction in the student government’s payment affects club revenues.

This means the club’s revenues will remain $200 if it has no passengers on a particular trip. Revenue will, however, be different when the club has passengers.
