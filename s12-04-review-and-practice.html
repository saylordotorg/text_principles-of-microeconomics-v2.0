        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p01">The assumptions of the model of perfect competition ensure that every decision maker is a price taker—the interaction of demand and supply in the market determines price. Although most firms in real markets have some control over their prices, the model of perfect competition suggests how changes in demand or in production cost will affect price and output in a wide range of real-world cases.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p02">A firm in perfect competition maximizes profit in the short run by producing an output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, provided marginal revenue is at least as great as the minimum value of average variable cost. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue equals price and average revenue. This implies that the firm’s marginal cost curve is its short-run supply curve for values greater than average variable cost. If price drops below average variable cost, the firm shuts down.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p03">If firms in an industry are earning economic profit, entry by new firms will drive price down until economic profit achieves its long-run equilibrium value of zero. If firms are suffering economic losses, exit by existing firms will continue until price rises to eliminate the losses and economic profits are zero. A long-run equilibrium may be changed by a change in demand or in production cost, which would affect supply. The adjustment to the change in the short run is likely to result in economic profits or losses; these will be eliminated in the long run by entry or by exit.</p>

            <li>Explain how each of the assumptions of perfect competition contributes to the fact that all decision makers in perfect competition are price takers.</li>
            <li>If the assumptions of perfect competition are not likely to be met in the real world, how can the model be of any use?</li>
            <li>Explain the difference between marginal revenue, average revenue, and price in perfect competition.</li>
            <li>Suppose the only way a firm can increase its sales is to lower its price. Is this a perfectly competitive firm? Why or why not?</li>

            </li>
            <li>Explain why an economic profit of zero is acceptable to a firm.</li>
            <li>Explain why a perfectly competitive firm whose average total cost exceeds the market price may continue to operate in the short run. What about the long run?</li>
            <li>You have decided to major in biology rather than computer science. A news report suggests that the salaries of computer science majors are increasing. How does this affect the opportunity cost of your choice?</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s05_p18">Explain how each of the following events would affect the marginal cost curves of firms and thus the supply curve in a perfectly competitive market in the short run.</p>

            <li>In a perfectly competitive market, who benefits from an event that lowers production costs for firms?</li>
            <li>Dry-cleaning establishments generate a considerable amount of air pollution in producing cleaning services. Suppose these firms are allowed to pollute without restriction and that reducing their pollution would add significantly to their production costs. Who benefits from the fact that they pollute the air? Now suppose the government requires them to reduce their pollution. Who will pay for the cleanup? (Assume dry cleaning is a perfectly competitive industry, and answer these questions from a long-run perspective.)</li>
            <li>The late columnist William F. Buckley, commenting on a strike by the Teamsters Union against UPS in 1997, offered this bit of economic analysis to explain how UPS had succeeded in reducing its average total cost: “UPS has done this by ‘economies of scale.’ Up to a point (where the marginal cost equals the price of the marginal unit), the larger the business, the less the per-unit cost.” Use the concept of economies of scale, together with the information presented in this chapter, to explain the error in Mr. Buckley’s statement. <span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenberg-fn09_001">William F. Buckley, “Carey Took on ‘Greed’ as His Battle Cry,” <em class="emphasis">The Gazette</em>, 22 August 1997, News 7 (a Universal Press Syndicate column).</span>
</li>
            <li>Suppose that a perfectly competitive industry is in long-run equilibrium and experiences an increase in production cost. Who will bear the burden of the increase? Is this fair?</li>
            <li>Economists argue that the ultimate beneficiaries of the efforts of perfectly competitive firms are consumers. In what sense is this the case? Do the owners of perfectly competitive firms derive any long-run benefit from their efforts?</li>
            <li>Explain carefully why a fixed license fee does not shift a firm’s marginal cost curve in the short run. What about the long run?</li>

Show graphically how the price and output for the market and for a single firm will be affected in the short run and in the long run. Assume the market is perfectly competitive and that it is initially in long-run equilibrium at a price of $12 per car wash. Assume also that input prices don’t change as the market responds to the change in demand.</li>
