    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_p01">A glance through the pages of this book should convince you that there are a lot of graphs in economics. The language of graphs is one means of presenting economic ideas. If you are already familiar with graphs, you will have no difficulty with this aspect of your study. If you have never used graphs or have not used them in some time, this appendix will help you feel comfortable with the graphs you will encounter in this text.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_p01">Much of the analysis in economics deals with relationships between variables. A variable is simply a quantity whose value can change. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">graph</a><span class="glossdef">A pictorial representation of the relationship between two or more variables.</span></span> is a pictorial representation of the relationship between two or more variables. The key to understanding graphs is knowing the rules that apply to their construction and interpretation. This section defines those rules and explains how to draw a graph.</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Drawing a Graph</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_p01">To see how a graph is constructed from numerical data, we will consider a hypothetical example. Suppose a college campus has a ski club that organizes day-long bus trips to a ski area about 100 miles from the campus. The club leases the bus and charges $10 per passenger for a round trip to the ski area. In addition to the revenue the club collects from passengers, it also receives a grant of $200 from the school’s student government for each day the bus trip is available. The club thus would receive $200 even if no passengers wanted to ride on a particular day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_p02">The table in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a> shows the relationship between two variables: the number of students who ride the bus on a particular day and the revenue the club receives from a trip. In the table, each combination is assigned a letter (A, B, etc.); we will use these letters when we transfer the information from the table to a graph.</p>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 21.1</span> Ski Club Revenues</p>
            <img src="section_24/ffdadb4bcc4dc56effe25e0a203482a1.jpg">
            <p class="para">The ski club receives $10 from each passenger riding its bus for a trip to and from the ski area plus a payment of $200 from the student government for each day the bus is available for these trips. The club’s revenues from any single day thus equal $200 plus $10 times the number of passengers. The table relates various combinations of the number of passengers and club revenues.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_p03">We can illustrate the relationship shown in the table with a graph. The procedure for showing the relationship between two variables, like the ones in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a>, on a graph is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a>. Let us look at the steps involved.</p>

            <p class="para">Here we see how to show the information given in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a> in a graph.</p>

        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1. Draw and Label the Axes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p01">The two variables shown in the table are the number of passengers taking the bus on a particular day and the club’s revenue from that trip. We begin our graph in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a> by drawing two axes to form a right angle. Each axis will represent a variable. The axes should be carefully labeled to reflect what is being measured on each axis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p02">It is customary to place the independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. Recall that, when two variables are related, the dependent variable is the one that changes in response to changes in the independent variable. Passengers generate revenue, so we can consider the number of passengers as the independent variable and the club’s revenue as the dependent variable. The number of passengers thus goes on the horizontal axis; the club’s revenue from a trip goes on the vertical axis. In some cases, the variables in a graph cannot be considered independent or dependent. In those cases, the variables may be placed on either axis; we will encounter such a case in the chapter that introduces the production possibilities model. In other cases, economists simply ignore the rule; we will encounter that case in the chapter that introduces the model of demand and supply. The rule that the independent variable goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable goes on the vertical usually holds, but not always.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p03">The point at which the axes intersect is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">origin</a><span class="glossdef">The point at which the axes of a graph intersect.</span></span> of the graph. Notice that in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f02">Figure 21.2 "Plotting a Graph"</a> the origin has a value of zero for each variable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p04">In drawing a graph showing numeric values, we also need to put numbers on the axes. For the axes in Panel (a), we have chosen numbers that correspond to the values in the table. The number of passengers ranges up to 40 for a trip; club revenues from a trip range from $200 (the payment the club receives from student government) to $600. We have extended the vertical axis to $800 to allow some changes we will consider below. We have chosen intervals of 10 passengers on the horizontal axis and $100 on the vertical axis. The choice of particular intervals is mainly a matter of convenience in drawing and reading the graph; we have chosen the ones here because they correspond to the intervals given in the table.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s01_p05">We have drawn vertical lines from each of the values on the horizontal axis and horizontal lines from each of the values on the vertical axis. These lines, called gridlines, will help us in Step 2.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2. Plot the Points</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p06">Each of the rows in the table in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Ski Club Revenues"</a> gives a combination of the number of passengers on the bus and club revenue from a particular trip. We can plot these values in our graph.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p07">We begin with the first row, A, corresponding to zero passengers and club revenue of $200, the payment from student government. We read up from zero passengers on the horizontal axis to $200 on the vertical axis and mark point A. This point shows that zero passengers result in club revenues of $200.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p08">The second combination, B, tells us that if 10 passengers ride the bus, the club receives $300 in revenue from the trip—$100 from the $10-per-passenger charge plus the $200 from student government. We start at 10 passengers on the horizontal axis and follow the gridline up. When we travel up in a graph, we are traveling with respect to values on the vertical axis. We travel up by $300 and mark point B.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p09">Points in a graph have a special significance. They relate the values of the variables on the two axes to each other. Reading to the left from point B, we see that it shows $300 in club revenue. Reading down from point B, we see that it shows 10 passengers. Those values are, of course, the values given for combination B in the table.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p10">We repeat this process to obtain points C, D, and E. Check to be sure that you see that each point corresponds to the values of the two variables given in the corresponding row of the table.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s02_p11">The graph in Panel (b) is called a scatter diagram. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scatter diagram</a><span class="glossdef">A graph that shows individual points relating values of the variable on one axis to values of the variable on the other.</span></span> shows individual points relating values of the variable on one axis to values of the variable on the other.</p>

        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3. Draw the Curve</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03_p01">The final step is to draw the curve that shows the relationship between the number of passengers who ride the bus and the club’s revenues from the trip. The term “curve” is used for any line in a graph that shows a relationship between two variables.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03_p02">We draw a line that passes through points A through E. Our curve shows club revenues; we shall call it <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. Notice that <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> is an upward-sloping straight line. Notice also that <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> intersects the vertical axis at $200 (point A). The point at which a curve intersects an axis is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intercept</a><span class="glossdef">The point at which a curve intersects an axis.</span></span> of the curve. We often refer to the vertical or horizontal intercept of a curve; such intercepts can play a special role in economic analysis. The vertical intercept in this case shows the revenue the club would receive on a day it offered the trip and no one rode the bus.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s01_s03_p03">To check your understanding of these steps, we recommend that you try plotting the points and drawing <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> for yourself in Panel (a). Better yet, draw the axes for yourself on a sheet of graph paper and plot the curve.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Slope of a Curve</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p01">In this section, we will see how to compute the slope of a curve. The slopes of curves tell an important story: they show the rate at which one variable changes with respect to another.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">slope</a><span class="glossdef">The ratio of the change in the value of the variable on the vertical axis to the change in the value of the variable on the horizontal axis  measured between two points on the curve.</span></span> of a curve equals the ratio of the change in the value of the variable on the vertical axis to the change in the value of the variable on the horizontal axis, measured between two points on the curve. You may have heard this called “the rise over the run.” In equation form, we can write the definition of the slope as</p>

In this example, the equation is written in words. Sometimes we use symbols in place of words. The basic idea though, is always the same: the term represented on the left side of the equals sign equals the term on the right side. In <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_eq01" xrefstyle="select: label">Equation 21.1</a> there are three variables: the slope, the vertical change, and the horizontal change. If we know the values of two of the three, we can compute the third. In the computation of slopes that follow, for example, we will use values for the two variables on the right side of the equation to compute the slope.</p>

Point B corresponds to club revenues of $300; point D corresponds to club revenues of $500. The change in the vertical axis equals $200.

It should come as no surprise that this amount equals the price per passenger. Adding a passenger adds $10 to the club’s revenues.</p>
        <p class="para block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p11">Notice that we can compute the slope of <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> between any two points on the curve and get the same value; the slope is constant. Consider, for example, points A and E. The vertical change between these points is $400 (we go from revenues of $200 at A to revenues of $600 at E). The horizontal change is 40 passengers (from zero passengers at A to 40 at E). The slope between A and E thus equals <span class="inlineequation"><span class="mathphrase">$400/(40 passengers) = $10/passenger</span></span>. We get the same slope regardless of which pair of points we pick on <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to compute the slope. The slope of <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> can be considered a constant, which suggests that it is a straight line. When the curve showing the relationship between two variables has a constant slope, we say there is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">linear relationship</a><span class="glossdef">Relationship that exists between two variables when the curve between them has a constant slope.</span></span> between the variables. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">linear curve</a><span class="glossdef">A curve with constant slope.</span></span> is a curve with constant slope.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s02_p12">The fact that the slope of our curve equals $10/passenger tells us something else about the curve—$10/passenger is a positive, not a negative, value. A curve whose slope is positive is upward sloping. As we travel up and to the right along <em class="emphasis">R</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, we travel in the direction of increasing values for both variables. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">positive relationship</a><span class="glossdef">Relationship that exists between two variables when both variables move in the same direction.</span></span> between two variables is one in which both variables move in the same direction. Positive relationships are sometimes called direct relationships. There is a positive relationship between club revenues and passengers on the bus. We will look at a graph showing a negative relationship between two variables in the next section.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Graph Showing a Negative Relationship</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">negative relationship</a><span class="glossdef">Relationship that exists between two variables when the variables move in opposite directions.</span></span> is one in which two variables move in opposite directions. A negative relationship is sometimes called an inverse relationship. The slope of a curve describing a negative relationship is always negative. A curve with a negative slope is always downward sloping.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p02">As an example of a graph of a negative relationship, let us look at the impact of the cancellation of games by the National Basketball Association during the 1998–1999 labor dispute on the earnings of one player: Shaquille O’Neal. During the 1998–1999 season, O’Neal was the center for the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p03">O’Neal’s salary with the Lakers in 1998–1999 would have been about $17,220,000 had the 82 scheduled games of the regular season been played. But a contract dispute between owners and players resulted in the cancellation of 32 games. Mr. O’Neal’s salary worked out to roughly $210,000 per game, so the labor dispute cost him well over $6 million. Presumably, he was able to eke out a living on his lower income, but the cancellation of games cost him a great deal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_p04">We show the relationship between the number of games canceled and O’Neal’s 1998–1999 basketball earnings graphically in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s01_s03_f01">Figure 21.5 "Canceling Games and Reducing Shaquille O’Neal’s Earnings"</a>. Canceling games reduced his earnings, so the number of games canceled is the independent variable and goes on the horizontal axis. O’Neal’s earnings are the dependent variable and go on the vertical axis. The graph assumes that his earnings would have been $17,220,000 had no games been canceled (point A, the vertical intercept). Assuming that his earnings fell by $210,000 per game canceled, his earnings for the season were reduced to $10,500,000 by the cancellation of 32 games (point B). We can draw a line between these two points to show the relationship between games canceled and O’Neal’s 1998–1999 earnings from basketball. In this graph, we have inserted a break in the vertical axis near the origin. This allows us to expand the scale of the axis over the range from $10,000,000 to $18,000,000. It also prevents a large blank space between the origin and an income of $10,500,000—there are no values below this amount.</p>

In this text, we will not have occasion to compute the slopes of tangent lines. Either they will be given or we will use them as we did here—to see what is happening to the slopes of nonlinear curves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s01_p10">In the case of our curve for loaves of bread produced, the fact that the slope of the curve falls as we increase the number of bakers suggests a phenomenon that plays a central role in both microeconomic and macroeconomic analysis. As we add workers (in this case bakers), output (in this case loaves of bread) rises, but by smaller and smaller amounts. Another way to describe the relationship between the number of workers and the quantity of bread produced is to say that as the number of workers increases, the output increases at a decreasing rate. In Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s02_s01_f03">Figure 21.11 "Tangent Lines and the Slopes of Nonlinear Curves"</a> we express this idea with a graph, and we can gain this understanding by looking at the tangent lines, even though we do not have specific numbers. Indeed, much of our work with graphs will not require numbers at all.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Graphs Without Numbers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p01">We know that a positive relationship between two variables can be shown with an upward-sloping curve in a graph. A negative or inverse relationship can be shown with a downward-sloping curve. Some relationships are linear and some are nonlinear. We illustrate a linear relationship with a curve whose slope is constant; a nonlinear relationship is illustrated with a curve whose slope changes. Using these basic ideas, we can illustrate hypotheses graphically even in cases in which we do not have numbers with which to locate specific points.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p02">Consider first a hypothesis suggested by recent medical research: eating more fruits and vegetables each day increases life expectancy. We can show this idea graphically. Daily fruit and vegetable consumption (measured, say, in grams per day) is the independent variable; life expectancy (measured in years) is the dependent variable. Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_f01">Figure 21.12 "Graphs Without Numbers"</a> shows the hypothesis, which suggests a positive relationship between the two variables. Notice the vertical intercept on the curve we have drawn; it implies that even people who eat no fruit or vegetables can expect to live at least a while!</p>

            <p class="para">We often use graphs without numbers to suggest the nature of relationships between variables. The graphs in the four panels correspond to the relationships described in the text.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p03">Panel (b) illustrates another hypothesis we hear often: smoking cigarettes reduces life expectancy. Here the number of cigarettes smoked per day is the independent variable; life expectancy is the dependent variable. The hypothesis suggests a negative relationship. Hence, we have a downward-sloping curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p04">Now consider a general form of the hypothesis suggested by the example of Felicia Alvarez’s bakery: increasing employment each period increases output each period, but by smaller and smaller amounts. As we saw in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s02_s01_f01">Figure 21.9 "A Nonlinear Curve"</a>, this hypothesis suggests a positive, nonlinear relationship. We have drawn a curve in Panel (c) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_f01">Figure 21.12 "Graphs Without Numbers"</a> that looks very much like the curve for bread production in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s02_s01_f03">Figure 21.11 "Tangent Lines and the Slopes of Nonlinear Curves"</a>. It is upward sloping, and its slope diminishes as employment rises.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p05">Finally, consider a refined version of our smoking hypothesis. Suppose we assert that smoking cigarettes does reduce life expectancy and that increasing the number of cigarettes smoked per day reduces life expectancy by a larger and larger amount. Panel (d) shows this case. Again, our life expectancy curve slopes downward. But now it suggests that smoking only a few cigarettes per day reduces life expectancy only a little but that life expectancy falls by more and more as the number of cigarettes smoked per day increases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p06">We have sketched lines tangent to the curve in Panel (d). The slopes of these tangent lines are negative, suggesting the negative relationship between smoking and life expectancy. They also get steeper as the number of cigarettes smoked per day rises. Whether a curve is linear or nonlinear, a steeper curve is one for which the absolute value of the slope rises as the value of the variable on the horizontal axis rises. When we speak of the absolute value of a negative number such as −4, we ignore the minus sign and simply say that the absolute value is 4. The absolute value of −8, for example, is greater than the absolute value of −4, and a curve with a slope of −8 is steeper than a curve whose slope is −4.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s02_s02_p07">Thus far our work has focused on graphs that show a relationship between variables. We turn finally to an examination of graphs and charts that show values of one or more variables, either over a period of time or at a single point in time.</p>

This is sometimes referred to as an inverse relationship. Variables that give a straight line with a constant slope are said to have a linear relationship. In this case, however, the relationship is nonlinear. The slope changes all along the curve. In this case the slope becomes steeper as we move downward to the right along the curve, as shown by the two tangent lines that have been drawn. As the quantity of B increases, the quantity of A decreases at an increasing rate.</p>

These pictures may take the form of graphs that show how a particular variable has changed over time, or charts that show values of a particular variable at a single point in time. We will close our introduction to graphs by looking at both ways of conveying information.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time-Series Graphs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_p01">One of the most common types of graphs used in economics is called a time-series graph. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">time-series graph</a><span class="glossdef">A graph that shows how the value of a particular variable or variables has changed over some period of time.</span></span> shows how the value of a particular variable or variables has changed over some period of time. One of the variables in a time-series graph is time itself. Time is typically placed on the horizontal axis in time-series graphs. The other axis can represent any variable whose value changes over time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_p01">The scaling of the vertical axis in time-series graphs can give very different views of economic data. We can make a variable appear to change a great deal, or almost not at all, depending on how we scale the axis. For that reason, it is important to note carefully how the vertical axis in a time-series graph is scaled.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_p02">Consider, for example, the issue of whether an increase or decrease in income tax rates has a significant effect on federal government revenues. This became a big issue in 1993, when President Clinton proposed an increase in income tax rates. The measure was intended to boost federal revenues. Critics of the president’s proposal argued that changes in tax rates have little or no effect on federal revenues. Higher tax rates, they said, would cause some people to scale back their income-earning efforts and thus produce only a small gain—or even a loss—in revenues. Op-ed essays in <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em>, for example, often showed a graph very much like that presented in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.14 "Two Tales of Taxes and Income"</a>. It shows federal revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of total income in the economy, since 1960. Various tax reductions and increases were enacted during that period, but Panel (a) appears to show they had little effect on federal revenues relative to total income.</p>

                <p class="para">A graph of federal revenues as a percentage of GDP emphasizes the stability of the relationship when plotted with the vertical axis scaled from 0 to 100, as in Panel (a). Scaling the vertical axis from 16 to 21%, as in Panel (b), stresses the short-term variability of the percentage and suggests that major tax rate changes have affected federal revenues.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_p03">Laura Tyson, then President Clinton’s chief economic adviser, charged that those graphs were misleading. In a <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> piece, she noted the scaling of the vertical axis used by the president’s critics. She argued that a more reasonable scaling of the axis shows that federal revenues tend to increase relative to total income in the economy and that cuts in taxes reduce the federal government’s share. Her alternative version of these events does, indeed, suggest that federal receipts have tended to rise and fall with changes in tax policy, as shown in Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.14 "Two Tales of Taxes and Income"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_p04">Which version is correct? Both are. Both graphs show the same data. It is certainly true that federal revenues, relative to economic activity, have been remarkably stable over the past several decades, as emphasized by the scaling in Panel (a). But it is also true that the federal share has varied between about 17 and 20%. And a small change in the federal share translates into a large amount of tax revenue.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_p05">It is easy to be misled by time-series graphs. Large changes can be made to appear trivial and trivial changes to appear large through an artful scaling of the axes. The best advice for a careful consumer of graphical information is to note carefully the range of values shown and then to decide whether the changes are really significant.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s02_p06">John Maynard Keynes, one of the most famous economists ever, proposed in 1936 a hypothesis about total spending for consumer goods in the economy. He suggested that this spending was positively related to the income households receive. One way to test such a hypothesis is to draw a time-series graph of both variables to see whether they do, in fact, tend to move together. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s02_f02">Figure 21.15 "A Time-Series Graph of Disposable Income and Consumption"</a> shows the values of consumption spending and disposable income, which is after-tax income received by households. Annual values of consumption and disposable income are plotted for the period 1960–2007. Notice that both variables have tended to move quite closely together. The close relationship between consumption and disposable income is consistent with Keynes’s hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between the two variables.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-chappA_s03_s02_p07">Here are the time-series graphs, Panels (b) and (c), for the information in Panel (a). The first thing you should notice is that both graphs show that the inflation rate generally declined throughout the 1990s (with the exception of 1996, when it increased). The generally downward direction of the curve suggests that the trend of inflation was downward. Notice that in this case we do not say negative, since in this instance it is not the slope of the line that matters. Rather, inflation itself is still positive (as indicated by the fact that all the points are above the origin) but is declining. Finally, comparing Panels (b) and (c) suggests that the general downward trend in the inflation rate is emphasized less in Panel (b) than in Panel (c). This impression would be emphasized even more if the numbers on the vertical axis were increased in Panel (b) from 20 to 100. Just as in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-chappA_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.14 "Two Tales of Taxes and Income"</a>, it is possible to make large changes appear trivial by simply changing the scaling of the axes.</p>
