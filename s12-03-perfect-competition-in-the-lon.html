    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_p01">In the long run, a firm is free to adjust all of its inputs. New firms can enter any market; existing firms can leave their markets. We shall see in this section that the model of perfect competition predicts that, at a long-run equilibrium, production takes place at the lowest possible cost per unit and that all economic profits and losses are eliminated.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Profit and Economic Loss</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Economic profits and losses play a crucial role in the model of perfect competition. The existence of economic profits in a particular industry attracts new firms to the industry in the long run. As new firms enter, the supply curve shifts to the right, price falls, and profits fall. Firms continue to enter the industry until economic profits fall to zero. If firms in an industry are experiencing economic losses, some will leave. The supply curve shifts to the left, increasing price and reducing losses. Firms continue to leave until the remaining firms are no longer suffering losses—until economic profits are zero.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Before examining the mechanism through which entry and exit eliminate economic profits and losses, we shall examine an important key to understanding it: the difference between the accounting and economic concepts of profit and loss.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Versus Accounting Concepts of Profit and Loss</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p01">Economic profit equals total revenue minus total cost, where cost is measured in the economic sense as opportunity cost. An economic loss (negative economic profit) is incurred if total cost exceeds total revenue.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p02">Accountants include only explicit costs in their computation of total cost. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Explicit costs</a><span class="glossdef">Charges that must be paid for factors of production such as labor and capital.</span></span> include charges that must be paid for factors of production such as labor and capital, together with an estimate of depreciation. Profit computed using only explicit costs is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accounting profit</a><span class="glossdef">Profit computed using only explicit costs.</span></span>. It is the measure of profit firms typically report; firms pay taxes on their accounting profits, and a corporation reporting its profit for a particular period reports its accounting profits. To compute his accounting profits, Mr. Gortari, the radish farmer, would subtract explicit costs, such as charges for labor, equipment, and other supplies, from the revenue he receives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p03">Economists recognize costs in addition to the explicit costs listed by accountants. If Mr. Gortari were not growing radishes, he could be doing something else with the land and with his own efforts. Suppose the most valuable alternative use of his land would be to produce carrots, from which Mr. Gortari could earn $250 per month in accounting profits. The income he forgoes by not producing carrots is an opportunity cost of producing radishes. This cost is not explicit; the return Mr. Gortari could get from producing carrots will not appear on a conventional accounting statement of his accounting profit. A cost that is included in the economic concept of opportunity cost, but that is not an explicit cost, is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">implicit cost</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that is included in the economic concept of opportunity cost but that is not an explicit cost.</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p01">Given our definition of economic profits, we can easily see why, in perfect competition, they must always equal zero in the long run. Suppose there are two industries in the economy, and that firms in Industry A are earning economic profits. By definition, firms in Industry A are earning a return greater than the return available in Industry B. That means that firms in Industry B are earning less than they could in Industry A. Firms in Industry B are experiencing economic losses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p02">Given easy entry and exit, some firms in Industry B will leave it and enter Industry A to earn the greater profits available there. As they do so, the supply curve in Industry B will shift to the left, increasing prices and profits there. As former Industry B firms enter Industry A, the supply curve in Industry A will shift to the right, lowering profits in A. The process of firms leaving Industry B and entering A will continue until firms in both industries are earning zero economic profit. That suggests an important long-run result: <em class="emphasis">Economic profits in a system of perfectly competitive markets will, in the long run, be driven to zero in all industries</em>.</p>

The price of radishes is $0.40 per pound. Mr. Gortari’s average total cost at an output of 6,700 pounds of radishes per month is $0.26 per pound. Profit per unit is $0.14 ($0.40 − $0.26).

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p01">In our examination of entry and exit in response to economic profit or loss in a perfectly competitive industry, we assumed that the <em class="emphasis">ATC</em> curve of a single firm does not shift as new firms enter or existing firms leave the industry. That is the case when expansion or contraction does not affect prices for the factors of production used by firms in the industry. When expansion of the industry does not affect the prices of factors of production, it is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">constant-cost industry</a><span class="glossdef">Industry in which expansion does not affect the prices of factors of production.</span></span>. In some cases, however, the entry of new firms may affect input prices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p02">As new firms enter, they add to the demand for the factors of production used by the industry. If the industry is a significant user of those factors, the increase in demand could push up the market price of factors of production for all firms in the industry. If that occurs, then entry into an industry will boost average costs at the same time as it puts downward pressure on price. Long-run equilibrium will still occur at a zero level of economic profit and with firms operating on the lowest point on the <em class="emphasis">ATC</em> curve, but that cost curve will be somewhat higher than before entry occurred. Suppose, for example, that an increase in demand for new houses drives prices higher and induces entry. That will increase the demand for workers in the construction industry and is likely to result in higher wages in the industry, driving up costs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p03">An industry in which the entry of new firms bids up the prices of factors of production and thus increases production costs is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">increasing-cost industry</a><span class="glossdef">Industry in which the entry of new firms bids up the prices of factors of production and thus increases production costs.</span></span>. As such an industry expands in the long run, its price will rise.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p04">Some industries may experience reductions in input prices as they expand with the entry of new firms. That may occur because firms supplying the industry experience economies of scale as they increase production, thus driving input prices down. Expansion may also induce technological changes that lower input costs. That is clearly the case of the computer industry, which has enjoyed falling input costs as it has expanded. An industry in which production costs fall as firms enter in the long run is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decreasing-cost industry</a><span class="glossdef">Industry in which production costs fall in the long run as firms enter.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p05">Just as industries may expand with the entry of new firms, they may contract with the exit of existing firms. In a constant-cost industry, exit will not affect the input prices of remaining firms. In an increasing-cost industry, exit will reduce the input prices of remaining firms. And, in a decreasing-cost industry, input prices may rise with the exit of existing firms.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s01_s05_p06">The behavior of production costs as firms in an industry expand or reduce their output has important implications for the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long-run industry supply curve</a><span class="glossdef">A curve that relates the price of a good or service to the quantity produced after all long-run adjustments to a price change have been completed.</span></span>, a curve that relates the price of a good or service to the quantity produced after all long-run adjustments to a price change have been completed. Every point on a long-run supply curve therefore shows a price and quantity supplied at which firms in the industry are earning zero economic profit. Unlike the short-run market supply curve, the long-run industry supply curve does not hold factor costs and the number of firms unchanged.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_p01">The primary application of the model of perfect competition is in predicting how firms will respond to changes in demand and in production costs. To see how firms respond to a particular change, we determine how the change affects demand or cost conditions and then see how the profit-maximizing solution is affected in the short run and in the long run. Having determined how the profit-maximizing firms of the model would respond, we can then predict firms’ responses to similar changes in the real world.</p>

                <p class="para">The initial equilibrium price, $27, and quantity, <em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, of automobile oil changes are determined by the intersection of market demand, <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, and market supply, <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> in Panel (a). The industry is in long-run equilibrium; a typical firm, shown in Panel (b), earns zero economic profit.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p03">A reduction in production cost shifts the firm’s cost curves down. The firm’s average total cost and marginal cost curves shift down, as shown in Panel (b). In Panel (a) the supply curve shifts from <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The industry supply curve is made up of the marginal cost curves of individual firms; because each of them has shifted downward by $3, the industry supply curve shifts downward by $3.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p04">Notice that price in the short run falls to $26; it does not fall by the $3 reduction in cost. That is because the supply and demand curves are sloped. While the supply curve shifts downward by $3, its intersection with the demand curve falls by less than $3. The firm in Panel (b) responds to the lower price and lower cost by increasing output to <em class="emphasis">q</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, where <em class="emphasis">MC</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> and <em class="emphasis">MR</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> intersect.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p05">An increase in variable costs would shift the average total, average variable, and marginal cost curves upward. It would shift the industry supply curve upward by the same amount. The result in the short run would be an increase in price, but by less than the increase in cost per unit. Firms would experience economic losses, causing exit in the long run. Eventually, price would increase by the full amount of the increase in production cost.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p06">Some cost increases will not affect marginal cost. Suppose, for example, that an annual license fee of $5,000 is imposed on firms in a particular industry. The fee is a fixed cost; it does not affect marginal cost. Imposing such a fee shifts the average total cost curve upward but causes no change in marginal cost. There is no change in price or output in the short run. Because firms are suffering economic losses, there will be exit in the long run. Prices ultimately rise by enough to cover the cost of the fee, leaving the remaining firms in the industry with zero economic profit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p07">Price will change to reflect whatever change we observe in production cost. A change in variable cost causes price to change in the short run. In the long run, any change in average total cost changes price by an equal amount.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p08">The message of long-run equilibrium in a competitive market is a profound one. The ultimate beneficiaries of the innovative efforts of firms are consumers. Firms in a perfectly competitive world earn zero profit in the long-run. While firms can earn accounting profits in the long-run, they cannot earn economic profits.</p>

                    <li>The economic concept of profit differs from accounting profit. The accounting concept deals only with explicit costs, while the economic concept of profit incorporates explicit and implicit costs.</li>
                    <li>The existence of economic profits attracts entry, economic losses lead to exit, and in long-run equilibrium, firms in a perfectly competitive industry will earn zero economic profit.</li>
                    <li>The long-run supply curve in an industry in which expansion does not change input prices (a constant-cost industry) is a horizontal line. The long-run supply curve for an industry in which production costs increase as output rises (an increasing-cost industry) is upward sloping. The long-run supply curve for an industry in which production costs decrease as output rises (a decreasing-cost industry) is downward sloping.</li>
                    <li>In a perfectly competitive market in long-run equilibrium, an increase in demand creates economic profit in the short run and induces entry in the long run; a reduction in demand creates economic losses (negative economic profits) in the short run and forces some firms to exit the industry in the long run.</li>
                    <li>When production costs change, price will change by less than the change in production cost in the short run. Price will adjust to reflect fully the change in production cost in the long run.</li>
                    <li>A change in fixed cost will have no effect on price or output in the short run. It will induce entry or exit in the long run so that price will change by enough to leave firms earning zero economic profit.</li>

                <h3 class="title">Case in Point: Competition in the Market for Generic Prescription Drugs</h3>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p16">Generic prescription drugs are essentially identical substitutes for more expensive brand-name prescription drugs. Since the passage of the Drug Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act) made it easier for manufacturers to enter the market for generic drugs, the generic drug industry has taken off. Generic drugs represented 19% of the prescription drug industry in 1984 and today represent more than two-thirds of the industry. U.S. generic sales were $29 billion in 1995 and soared to $176 billion in 2009. In 2009, the average price of a branded prescription was $155 compared to $40 for a generic prescription.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p17">A study by David Reiffen and Michael R. Ward published in 2005 showed that entry into the generic drug industry has been the key to this price differential. As shown in the table, when there are one to three manufacturers selling generic copies of a given branded drug, the ratio of the generic price to the branded price is about 83%. The ratio falls to 76% when there are four to six competitors, 72.1% when there are seven to nine competitors, 69% when there are ten competitors, and 68% when there are eleven or more competitors.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p100">They also found that the extent to which prices approach competitive levels depends on the potential revenue in the market for a drug. So long as markets are sufficiently large, entry of generic competitors leads to prices that are close to marginal cost (i.e., at near-competitive pricing levels).</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p18">The generic drug industry is largely characterized by the attributes of a perfectly competitive market. Competitors have good information about the product and sell identical products. The 1984 legislation eased entry into this market. And as the model of perfect competition predicts, entry has driven prices down, benefiting consumers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars each year.</p>
