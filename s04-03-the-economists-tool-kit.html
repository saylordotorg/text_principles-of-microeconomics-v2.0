    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_p01">Economics differs from other social sciences because of its emphasis on opportunity cost, the assumption of maximization in terms of one’s own self-interest, and the analysis of choices at the margin. But certainly much of the basic methodology of economics and many of its difficulties are common to every social science—indeed, to every science. This section explores the application of the scientific method to economics.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_p02">Researchers often examine relationships between variables. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variable</a><span class="glossdef">Something whose value can change.</span></span> is something whose value can change. By contrast, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">constant</a><span class="glossdef">Something whose value does not change.</span></span> is something whose value does not change. The speed at which a car is traveling is an example of a variable. The number of minutes in an hour is an example of a constant.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_p03">Research is generally conducted within a framework called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scientific method</a><span class="glossdef">A systematic set of procedures through which knowledge is created.</span></span>, a systematic set of procedures through which knowledge is created. In the scientific method, hypotheses are suggested and then tested. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">An assertion of a relationship between two or more variables that could be proven to be false.</span></span> is an assertion of a relationship between two or more variables that could be proven to be false. A statement is not a hypothesis if no conceivable test could show it to be false. The statement “Plants like sunshine” is not a hypothesis; there is no way to test whether plants like sunshine or not, so it is impossible to prove the statement false. The statement “Increased solar radiation increases the rate of plant growth” is a hypothesis; experiments could be done to show the relationship between solar radiation and plant growth. If solar radiation were shown to be unrelated to plant growth or to retard plant growth, then the hypothesis would be demonstrated to be false.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_p04">If a test reveals that a particular hypothesis is false, then the hypothesis is rejected or modified. In the case of the hypothesis about solar radiation and plant growth, we would probably find that more sunlight increases plant growth over some range but that too much can actually retard plant growth. Such results would lead us to modify our hypothesis about the relationship between solar radiation and plant growth.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_p05">If the tests of a hypothesis yield results consistent with it, then further tests are conducted. A hypothesis that has not been rejected after widespread testing and that wins general acceptance is commonly called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">theory</a><span class="glossdef">A hypothesis that has not been rejected after widespread testing and that wins general acceptance.</span></span>. A theory that has been subjected to even more testing and that has won virtually universal acceptance becomes a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law</a><span class="glossdef">A theory that has been subjected to even more testing and that has won virtually universal acceptance.</span></span>. We will examine two economic laws in the next two chapters.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_p06">Even a hypothesis that has achieved the status of a law cannot be proven true. There is always a possibility that someone may find a case that invalidates the hypothesis. That possibility means that nothing in economics, or in any other social science, or in any science, can ever be <em class="emphasis">proven</em> true. We can have great confidence in a particular proposition, but it is always a mistake to assert that it is “proven.”</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Models in Economics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s01_p01">All scientific thought involves simplifications of reality. The real world is far too complex for the human mind—or the most powerful computer—to consider. Scientists use models instead. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">model</a><span class="glossdef">A set of simplifying assumptions about some aspect of the real world.</span></span> is a set of simplifying assumptions about some aspect of the real world. Models are always based on assumed conditions that are simpler than those of the real world, assumptions that are necessarily false. A model of the real world cannot <em class="emphasis">be</em> the real world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s01_p02">We will encounter an economic model in <a class="xref" href="rittenberg-ch02#rittenberg-ch02">Chapter 2 "Confronting Scarcity: Choices in Production"</a>. For that model, we will assume that an economy can produce only two goods. Then we will explore the model of demand and supply. One of the assumptions we will make there is that all the goods produced by firms in a particular market are identical. Of course, real economies and real markets are not that simple. Reality is never as simple as a model; one point of a model is to simplify the world to improve our understanding of it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s01_p03">Economists often use graphs to represent economic models. The appendix to this chapter provides a quick, refresher course, if you think you need one, on understanding, building, and using graphs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s01_p04">Models in economics also help us to generate hypotheses about the real world. In the next section, we will examine some of the problems we encounter in testing those hypotheses.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Testing Hypotheses in Economics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_p01">Here is a hypothesis suggested by the model of demand and supply: an increase in the price of gasoline will reduce the quantity of gasoline consumers demand. How might we test such a hypothesis?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_p02">Economists try to test hypotheses such as this one by observing actual behavior and using empirical (that is, real-world) data. The average retail price of gasoline in the United States rose from an average of $2.12 per gallon on May 22, 2005 to $2.88 per gallon on May 22, 2006. The number of gallons of gasoline consumed by U.S. motorists rose 0.3% during that period.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_p03">The small increase in the quantity of gasoline consumed by motorists as its price rose is inconsistent with the hypothesis that an increased price will lead to a reduction in the quantity demanded. Does that mean that we should dismiss the original hypothesis? On the contrary, we must be cautious in assessing this evidence. Several problems exist in interpreting any set of economic data. One problem is that several things may be changing at once; another is that the initial event may be unrelated to the event that follows. The next two sections examine these problems in detail.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The All-Other-Things-Unchanged Problem</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p01">The hypothesis that an increase in the price of gasoline produces a reduction in the quantity demanded by consumers carries with it the assumption that there are no other changes that might also affect consumer demand. A better statement of the hypothesis would be: An increase in the price of gasoline will reduce the quantity consumers demand, ceteris paribus. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ceteris paribus</a><span class="glossdef">A Latin phrase that means, “all other things unchanged.“</span></span> is a Latin phrase that means “all other things unchanged.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p02">But things changed between May 2005 and May 2006. Economic activity and incomes rose both in the United States and in many other countries, particularly China, and people with higher incomes are likely to buy more gasoline. Employment rose as well, and people with jobs use more gasoline as they drive to work. Population in the United States grew during the period. In short, many things happened during the period, all of which tended to increase the quantity of gasoline people purchased.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p03">Our observation of the gasoline market between May 2005 and May 2006 did not offer a conclusive test of the hypothesis that an increase in the price of gasoline would lead to a reduction in the quantity demanded by consumers. Other things changed and affected gasoline consumption. Such problems are likely to affect any analysis of economic events. We cannot ask the world to stand still while we conduct experiments in economic phenomena. Economists employ a variety of statistical methods to allow them to isolate the impact of single events such as price changes, but they can never be certain that they have accurately isolated the impact of a single event in a world in which virtually everything is changing all the time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p04">In laboratory sciences such as chemistry and biology, it is relatively easy to conduct experiments in which only selected things change and all other factors are held constant. The economists’ laboratory is the real world; thus, economists do not generally have the luxury of conducting controlled experiments.</p>

        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Fallacy of False Cause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p01">Hypotheses in economics typically specify a relationship in which a change in one variable causes another to change. We call the variable that responds to the change the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dependent variable</a><span class="glossdef">A variable that responds to change.</span></span>; the variable that induces a change is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">independent variable</a><span class="glossdef">A variable that induces a change.</span></span>. Sometimes the fact that two variables move together can suggest the false conclusion that one of the variables has acted as an independent variable that has caused the change we observe in the dependent variable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p02">Consider the following hypothesis: People wearing shorts cause warm weather. Certainly, we observe that more people wear shorts when the weather is warm. Presumably, though, it is the warm weather that causes people to wear shorts rather than the wearing of shorts that causes warm weather; it would be incorrect to infer from this that people cause warm weather by wearing shorts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p03">Reaching the incorrect conclusion that one event causes another because the two events tend to occur together is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fallacy of false cause</a><span class="glossdef">The incorrect assumption that one event causes another because the two events tend to occur together.</span></span>. The accompanying essay on baldness and heart disease suggests an example of this fallacy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p04">Because of the danger of the fallacy of false cause, economists use special statistical tests that are designed to determine whether changes in one thing actually do cause changes observed in another. Given the inability to perform controlled experiments, however, these tests do not always offer convincing evidence that persuades all economists that one thing does, in fact, cause changes in another.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p05">In the case of gasoline prices and consumption between May 2005 and May 2006, there is good theoretical reason to believe the price increase should lead to a reduction in the quantity consumers demand. And economists have tested the hypothesis about price and the quantity demanded quite extensively. They have developed elaborate statistical tests aimed at ruling out problems of the fallacy of false cause. While we cannot prove that an increase in price will, ceteris paribus, lead to a reduction in the quantity consumers demand, we can have considerable confidence in the proposition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Normative and Positive Statements</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p01">Two kinds of assertions in economics can be subjected to testing. We have already examined one, the hypothesis. Another testable assertion is a statement of fact, such as “It is raining outside” or “Microsoft is the largest producer of operating systems for personal computers in the world.” Like hypotheses, such assertions can be demonstrated to be false. Unlike hypotheses, they can also be shown to be correct. A statement of fact or a hypothesis is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">positive statement</a><span class="glossdef">A statement of fact or a hypothesis.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p02">Although people often disagree about positive statements, such disagreements can ultimately be resolved through investigation. There is another category of assertions, however, for which investigation can never resolve differences. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">normative statement</a><span class="glossdef">A statement that makes a value judgment.</span></span> is one that makes a value judgment. Such a judgment is the opinion of the speaker; no one can “prove” that the statement is or is not correct. Here are some examples of normative statements in economics: “We ought to do more to help the poor.” “People in the United States should save more.” “Corporate profits are too high.” The statements are based on the values of the person who makes them. They cannot be proven false.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p03">Because people have different values, normative statements often provoke disagreement. An economist whose values lead him or her to conclude that we should provide more help for the poor will disagree with one whose values lead to a conclusion that we should not. Because no test exists for these values, these two economists will continue to disagree, unless one persuades the other to adopt a different set of values. Many of the disagreements among economists are based on such differences in values and therefore are unlikely to be resolved.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p10">A website called <a class="link" href="http://www.embarrassingproblems.com">embarrassingproblems.com</a> received the following email:</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p13">What did Dr. Margaret answer? Most importantly, she did not recommend that the questioner take drugs to treat his baldness, because doctors do not think that the baldness causes the heart disease. A more likely explanation for the association between baldness and heart disease is that both conditions are affected by an underlying factor. While noting that more research needs to be done, one hypothesis that Dr. Margaret offers is that higher testosterone levels might be triggering both the hair loss and the heart disease. The good news for people with early balding (which is really where the association with increased risk of heart disease has been observed) is that they have a signal that might lead them to be checked early on for heart disease.</p>
