        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch07_s05_p01">In this chapter we have examined the model of utility-maximizing behavior. Economists assume that consumers make choices consistent with the objective of achieving the maximum total utility possible for a given budget constraint.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch07_s05_p02">Utility is a conceptual measure of satisfaction; it is not actually measurable. The theory of utility maximization allows us to ask how a utility-maximizing consumer would respond to a particular event.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch07_s05_p03">By following the marginal decision rule, consumers will achieve the utility-maximizing condition: Expenditures equal consumers’ budgets, and ratios of marginal utility to price are equal for all pairs of goods and services. Thus, consumption is arranged so that the extra utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods and services. The marginal utility from a particular good or service eventually diminishes as consumers consume more of it during a period of time.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch07_s05_p04">Utility maximization underlies consumer demand. The amount by which the quantity demanded changes in response to a change in price consists of a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect always changes quantity demanded in a manner consistent with the law of demand. The income effect of a price change reinforces the substitution effect in the case of normal goods, but it affects consumption in an opposite direction in the case of inferior goods.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch07_s05_p05">An alternative approach to utility maximization uses indifference curves. This approach does not rely on the concept of marginal utility, and it gives us a graphical representation of the utility-maximizing condition.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenberg-ch07_s05_l01" numeration="arabic">
            <li>Suppose you really, <em class="emphasis">really</em> like ice cream. You <em class="emphasis">adore</em> ice cream. Does the law of diminishing marginal utility apply to your ice cream consumption?</li>
            <li>If two commodities that you purchase on a regular basis carry the same price, does that mean they both provide the same total utility? Marginal utility?</li>
            <li>If a person goes to the bowling alley planning to spend $15 but comes away with $5, what, if anything, can you conclude about the marginal utility of the alternatives (for example, bowl another line, have a soda or a sandwich) available to the person at the time he or she leaves?</li>
            <li>Which do you like more—going to the movies or watching rented DVDs at home? If you engage in both activities during the same period, say a week, explain why.</li>
            <li>Do you tend to eat more at a fixed-price buffet or when ordering from an a la carte menu? Explain, using the marginal decision rule that guides your behavior.</li>
            <li>Suppose there is a bill to increase the tax on cigarettes by $1 per pack coupled with an income tax cut of $500. Suppose a person smokes an average of 500 packs of cigarettes per year—and would thus face a tax increase of about $500 per year from the cigarette tax at the person’s current level of consumption. The income tax measure would increase the person’s after-tax income by $500. Would the combined measures be likely to have any effect on the person’s consumption of cigarettes? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>How does an increase in income affect a consumer’s budget line? His or her total utility?</li>
            <li>Why can Ms. Bain not consume at point Y in <a class="xref" href="rittenberg-ch07_s04#rittenberg-ch07_s04_s03_f01">Figure 7.10 "The Utility-Maximizing Solution"</a>?</li>
            <li>Suppose Ms. Bain is now consuming at point V in <a class="xref" href="rittenberg-ch07_s04#rittenberg-ch07_s04_s03_f01">Figure 7.10 "The Utility-Maximizing Solution"</a>. Use the marginal decision rule to explain why a shift to X would increase her utility.</li>
            <li>Suppose that you are a utility maximizer and so is your economics instructor. What can you conclude about your respective marginal rates of substitution for movies and concerts?</li>

During the day, he snacks on cartons of yogurt and the “house special” sandwiches at the Student Center cafeteria. A carton of yogurt costs $1.20; the Student Center often offers specials on the sandwiches, so their price varies a great deal. Sid has a budget of $36 per week for food at the Center. Five of Sid’s indifference curves are given by the schedule below; the points listed in the tables correspond to the points shown in the graph.</p>
