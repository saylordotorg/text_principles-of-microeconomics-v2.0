    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p01">Our analysis of production and cost begins with a period economists call the short run. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">short run</a><span class="glossdef">A planning period over which the managers of a firm must consider one or more of their factors of production as fixed in quantity.</span></span> in this microeconomic context is a planning period over which the managers of a firm must consider one or more of their factors of production as fixed in quantity. For example, a restaurant may regard its building as a fixed factor over a period of at least the next year. It would take at least that much time to find a new building or to expand or reduce the size of its present facility. Decisions concerning the operation of the restaurant during the next year must assume the building will remain unchanged. Other factors of production could be changed during the year, but the size of the building must be regarded as a constant.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p02">When the quantity of a factor of production cannot be changed during a particular period, it is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed factor of production</a><span class="glossdef">A factor of production whose quantity cannot be changed during a particular period.</span></span>. For the restaurant, its building is a fixed factor of production for at least a year. A factor of production whose quantity can be changed during a particular period is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variable factor of production</a><span class="glossdef">A factor of production whose quantity can be changed during a particular period.</span></span>; factors such as labor and food are examples.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p03">While the managers of the restaurant are making choices concerning its operation over the next year, they are also planning for longer periods. Over those periods, managers may contemplate alternatives such as modifying the building, building a new facility, or selling the building and leaving the restaurant business. The planning period over which a firm can consider <em class="emphasis">all</em> factors of production as variable is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long run</a><span class="glossdef">The planning period over which a firm can consider all factors of production as variable.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_p04">At any one time, a firm will be making both short-run and long-run choices. The managers may be planning what to do for the next few weeks and for the next few years. Their decisions over the next few weeks are likely to be short-run choices. Decisions that will affect operations over the next few years may be long-run choices, in which managers can consider changing every aspect of their operations. Our analysis in this section focuses on the short run. We examine long-run choices later in this chapter.</p>

When you read in the newspaper that productivity is rising or falling, or that productivity in the United States is nine times greater than productivity in China, the report is probably referring to some measure of the average product of labor.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p07">The total product curve in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> is repeated from <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 8.1 "Acme Clothing’s Total Product Curve"</a>. Panel (b) shows the marginal product and average product curves. Notice that marginal product is the slope of the total product curve, and that marginal product rises as the slope of the total product curve increases, falls as the slope of the total product curve declines, reaches zero when the total product curve achieves its maximum value, and becomes negative as the total product curve slopes downward. As in other parts of this text, marginal values are plotted at the midpoint of each interval. The marginal product of the fifth unit of labor, for example, is plotted between 4 and 5 units of labor. Also notice that the marginal product curve intersects the average product curve at the maximum point on the average product curve. When marginal product is above average product, average product is rising. When marginal product is below average product, average product is falling.</p>

Your grade point average (GPA) represents the average grade you have earned in all your course work so far. When you take an additional course, your grade in that course represents the marginal grade. What happens to your GPA when you get a grade that is higher than your previous average? It rises. What happens to your GPA when you get a grade that is lower than your previous average? It falls. If your GPA is a 3.0 and you earn one more B, your marginal grade equals your GPA and your GPA remains unchanged.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p09">The relationship between average product and marginal product is similar. However, unlike your course grades, which may go up and down willy-nilly, marginal product always rises and then falls, for reasons we will explore shortly. As soon as marginal product falls below average product, the average product curve slopes downward. While marginal product is above average product, whether marginal product is increasing or decreasing, the average product curve slopes upward.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p01">Adding the first worker increases Acme’s output from 0 to 1 jacket per day. The second tailor adds 2 jackets to total output; the third adds 4. The marginal product goes up because when there are more workers, each one can specialize to a degree. One worker might cut the cloth, another might sew the seams, and another might sew the buttonholes. Their increasing marginal products are reflected by the increasing slope of the total product curve over the first 3 units of labor and by the upward slope of the marginal product curve over the same range. The range over which marginal products are increasing is called the range of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">increasing marginal returns</a><span class="glossdef">The range over which each additional unit of a variable factor adds more to total output than the previous unit.</span></span>. Increasing marginal returns exist in the context of a total product curve for labor, so we are holding the quantities of other factors constant. Increasing marginal returns may occur for any variable factor.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p02">The fourth worker adds less to total output than the third; the marginal product of the fourth worker is 2 jackets. The data in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> show that marginal product continues to decline after the fourth worker as more and more workers are hired. The additional workers allow even greater opportunities for specialization, but because they are operating with a fixed amount of capital, each new worker adds less to total output. The fifth tailor adds only a single jacket to total output. When each additional unit of a variable factor adds less to total output, the firm is experiencing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diminishing marginal returns</a><span class="glossdef">The range over which each additional unit of a variable factor adds less to total output than the previous unit.</span></span>. Over the range of diminishing marginal returns, the marginal product of the variable factor is positive but falling. Once again, we assume that the quantities of all other factors of production are fixed. Diminishing marginal returns may occur for any variable factor. Panel (b) shows that Acme experiences diminishing marginal returns between the third and seventh workers, or between 7 and 11 jackets per day.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p03">After the seventh unit of labor, Acme’s fixed plant becomes so crowded that adding another worker actually reduces output.

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p05">It is easy to confuse the concept of diminishing marginal returns with the idea of negative marginal returns. To say a firm is experiencing diminishing marginal returns is not to say its output is falling. Diminishing marginal returns mean that the marginal product of a variable factor is declining. Output is still increasing as the variable factor is increased, but it is increasing by smaller and smaller amounts. As we saw in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 8.3 "Increasing Marginal Returns, Diminishing Marginal Returns, and Negative Marginal Returns"</a>, the range of diminishing marginal returns was between the third and seventh workers; over this range of workers, output rose from 7 to 11 jackets. Negative marginal returns started after the seventh worker.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p06">To see the logic of the law of diminishing marginal returns, imagine a case in which it does not hold. Say that you have a small plot of land for a vegetable garden, 10 feet by 10 feet in size. The plot itself is a fixed factor in the production of vegetables. Suppose you are able to hold constant all other factors—water, sunshine, temperature, fertilizer, and seed—and vary the amount of labor devoted to the garden. How much food could the garden produce? Suppose the marginal product of labor kept increasing or was constant. Then you could grow an <em class="emphasis">unlimited</em> quantity of food on your small plot—enough to feed the entire world! You could add an unlimited number of workers to your plot and still increase output at a constant or increasing rate. If you did not get enough output with, say, 500 workers, you could use 5 million; the five-millionth worker would add at least as much to total output as the first. If diminishing marginal returns to labor did not occur, the total product curve would slope upward at a constant or increasing rate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p07">The shape of the total product curve and the shape of the resulting marginal product curve drawn in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "From Total Product to the Average and Marginal Product of Labor"</a> are typical of <em class="emphasis">any</em> firm for the short run. Given its fixed factors of production, increasing the use of a variable factor will generate increasing marginal returns at first; the total product curve for the variable factor becomes steeper and the marginal product rises. The opportunity to gain from increased specialization in the use of the variable factor accounts for this range of increasing marginal returns. Eventually, though, diminishing returns will set in. The total product curve will become flatter, and the marginal product curve will fall.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_p01">A firm’s costs of production depend on the quantities and prices of its factors of production. Because we expect a firm’s output to vary with the firm’s use of labor in a specific way, we can also expect the firm’s costs to vary with its output in a specific way. We shall put our information about Acme’s product curves to work to discover how a firm’s costs vary with its level of output.</p>

For most firms, variable costs includes costs for raw materials, salaries of production workers, and utilities.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p01">Next we illustrate the relationship between Acme’s total product curve and its total costs. Acme can vary the quantity of labor it uses each day, so the cost of this labor is a variable cost. We assume capital is a fixed factor of production in the short run, so its cost is a fixed cost.</p>

If labor is the only variable factor, Acme’s total variable costs per day amount to $100 times the number of workers it employs. We can use the information given by the total product curve, together with the wage, to compute Acme’s total variable costs.</p>

The total variable cost of a jacket thus equals $100. Three units of labor produce 7 jackets per day; the total variable cost of 7 jackets equals $300. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 8.4 "Computing Variable Costs"</a> shows Acme’s total variable costs for producing each of the output levels given in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch08_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 8.1 "Acme Clothing’s Total Product Curve"</a>.</p>

The total cost curve, for example, starts at $200 when Acme produces 0 jackets—that is its total fixed cost. The curve rises, but at a decreasing rate, up to the seventh jacket. Beyond the seventh jacket, the curve becomes steeper and steeper. The slope of the total variable cost curve behaves in precisely the same way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p09">Recall that Acme experienced increasing marginal returns to labor for the first three units of labor—or the first seven jackets. Up to the third worker, each additional worker added more and more to Acme’s output. Over the range of increasing marginal returns, each additional jacket requires less and less additional labor. The first jacket required one tailor; the second required the addition of only a part-time tailor; the third required only that Acme boost that part-time tailor’s hours to a full day. Up to the seventh jacket, each additional jacket requires less and less additional labor, and thus costs rise at a decreasing rate; the total cost and total variable cost curves become flatter over the range of increasing marginal returns.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p10">Acme experiences diminishing marginal returns beyond the third unit of labor—or the seventh jacket. Notice that the total cost and total variable cost curves become steeper and steeper beyond this level of output. In the range of diminishing marginal returns, each additional unit of a factor adds less and less to total output. That means each additional unit of output requires larger and larger increases in the variable factor, and larger and larger increases in costs.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p18">How much should an athlete train?</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p19">Sports physiologists often measure the “total product” of training as the increase in an athlete’s aerobic capacity—the capacity to absorb oxygen into the bloodstream. An athlete can be thought of as producing aerobic capacity using a fixed factor (his or her natural capacity) and a variable input (exercise). The chart shows how this aerobic capacity varies with the number of workouts per week. The curve has a shape very much like a total product curve—which, after all, is precisely what it is.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p20">The data suggest that an athlete experiences increasing marginal returns from exercise for the first three days of training each week; indeed, over half the total gain in aerobic capacity possible is achieved. A person can become even more fit by exercising more, but the gains become smaller with each added day of training. The law of diminishing marginal returns applies to training.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p21">The increase in fitness that results from the sixth and seventh workouts each week is small. Studies also show that the costs of daily training, in terms of increased likelihood of injury, are high. Many trainers and coaches now recommend that athletes—at all levels of competition—take a day or two off each week.</p>

                    <li>The increased wage will shift the total variable cost curve upward; the old and new points and the corresponding curves are shown at the right.</li>
                    <li>The total variable cost curve has shifted upward because the cost of labor, Acme’s variable factor, has increased. The marginal cost curve shows the additional cost of each additional unit of output a firm produces. Because an increase in output requires more labor, and because labor now costs more, the marginal cost curve will shift upward. The increase in total variable cost will increase total cost; average total and average variable costs will rise as well. Average fixed cost will not change.</li>
